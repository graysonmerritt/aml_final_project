OBJECTIVES: The survival rate of people with HIV admitted to intensive care 
units (ICUs) is approaching that of people without HIV. We conducted a 
matched-cohort study of people with and without HIV admitted to ICU at a large 
hospital to compare short-term mortality, during 2000-2019.
METHODS: People with HIV were matched to people without HIV (1:2) on age, sex, 
admission year and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II 
score. Applying logistic regression models fitted using independence estimating 
equations, we describe population-averaged associations of HIV with short-term 
(in-ICU, in-hospital) mortality during a patient's first admission to ICU, and 
explore whether these varied by year.
RESULTS: A total of 177 people with HIV were matched to 354 people without HIV 
(71.2% vs. 71.2% male; median age: 47 vs. 48 years, median APACHE-II: 18 vs. 17, 
median admission year: 2013 vs. 2013). Among people with HIV, 73.4% were on 
antiretroviral therapy, 51.2% had HIV-RNA ≤50 copies/mL and median CD4 T-cell 
count was 132 cells/ μ L. People with HIV had higher in-ICU (24.3% vs. 15.3%) 
and in-hospital (31.6% vs. 20.1%) mortality. People with HIV had 1.69-fold 
higher odds (95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.76) of in-ICU mortality and 1.86 
(1.19-2.91) higher odds of in-hospital mortality than people without HIV, 
adjusted for age, sex, year and APACHE-II. There was no evidence that these 
associations varied by year (p-interaction-in-ICU = 0.90; 
p-interaction-in-hospital = 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that although outcomes have improved over 
time, people with HIV continue to have higher short-term in-ICU and in-hospital 
mortality following ICU admission compared with people without HIV with similar 
characteristics.

INTRODUCTION: The vaccination drive for COVID-19 was launched in India after the 
authorization of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Covishield), an adenoviral vector vaccine, and 
BBV152 COVID-19 (Covaxin), an inactivated virus vaccine. As stated by the CDC, 
vaccine-related adverse events can happen. In this study, we aimed to assess the 
timing of the COVID vaccination and admission diagnosis and their effect on ICU 
mortality. The time from vaccination can help identify adverse events directly 
related to vaccination.  Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted 
across four centers in India. Patients who took the first or second dose of any 
vaccines and were admitted with non-COVID illness to the ICU were included in 
the study. Patients were categorized based on the time interval from vaccination 
as ≤42 days or >42 days. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. The secondary 
outcomes were the length of ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 
53.49 (15.89) years, and 61.14% were males. The ICU mortality was 24.57% (18.38% 
to 31.63%). Thromboembolic events such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 
cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and mesenteric ischemia were seen in 7.43%, 
7.43%, and 1.14% of patients, respectively. Six patients (3.43%) developed 
neuromuscular illness. The mortality was higher in patients >66 years, followed 
by ≤35 years of age when admitted ≤42 days of vaccination (p=0.008). The 
mortality was higher in cerebrovascular disorders and was clinically significant 
(p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients developed thromboembolic events and neuromuscular diseases 
requiring ICU admission post-COVID vaccination. We observed a significantly 
higher mortality in the age groups >66 years and ≤35 years when admitted within 
42 days of COVID vaccination. Patients admitted with cerebrovascular diseases 
also had higher mortality.

OBJECTIVES: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy combined with 
enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols has improved postoperative 
outcomes, yet concerns persist regarding complications and readmissions. Limited 
research has explored intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and outcomes within 
this context. This study aimed to analyze ICU admissions following VATS 
lobectomy within an established ERAS protocol.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent VATS lobectomy between 2018-2023 
were included. Patient data were obtained from our prospective institutional 
database, while ICU data were extracted from electronic patients' records.
RESULTS: Of 2099 patients included, 48 (2.3%) required ICU admission. Median-age 
was 70 (IQR : 64-76), with ICU patients being older and predominantly male 
(73%). Overall 30-day-mortality was 1.0% with an ICU mortality of 31%. Multiple 
logistic regression revealed significant associations between ICU admission and 
male gender (p = <0.001), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.026), heart failure 
(p = 0.040), DLCO%(0.013). Median time to ICU admission was 4 days (IQR : 2-10). 
Respiratory failure was the primary reason for ICU admission (60%). Severe 
surgical complications accounted for 8.3% of all ICU-admissions.
CONCLUSIONS: In an ERAS setting, the incidence of ICU admission following VATS 
lobectomy was 2.3%, with a mortality rate of 31%. Respiratory failure was the 
leading cause of ICU admission.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Benign tracheal stenosis (TS) is a potentially life-threatening 
condition caused by iatrogenic events resulting from endotracheal intubation and 
tracheostomy. The study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics, 
management, and long-term outcomes of patients with simple or complex 
post-intubation tracheal stenosis (PITS) who were admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the ICU 
between June 2016 and June 2022 and diagnosed with PITS were performed until 
June 2023.
RESULTS: 76 patients (mean age 54.9 ± 17.3%, 63.2% male, 61.8% complex stenosis) 
admitted to the ICU were analysed. The diagnosis of PITS was made by fiberoptic 
bronchoscopy (FOB) in 53.9% and computed tomography (CT) in 46.1%. The most 
common location of stenosis was the upper trachea area (57.9%, n = 44). The 
median stenosis length of the TS was 1.9 cm (median 2 cm for complex stenosis, 
1 cm for simple stenosis, p < 0.001). Complex stenosis was associated with 
longer intubation time and multiple intubation history (p = 0.011, p = 0.028). 
At the same; complex stenosis was associated with prolonged and high stenosis 
percentage (p < 0.001). While dilatation and cryotherapy were sufficient for 
treatment in all patients with simple stenosis, the stent was applied to 34% 
patients with complex stenosis. Recurrence was higher in complex stenosis after 
bronchoscopic procedure (complex stenosis 95.7%, simple stenosis 17.2%). 19 
(25%) patients required surgical operation, and all of these patients had 
complex stenosis (p < 0.001). Median follow-up was 33 months for simple stenosis 
and 34 months for complex stenosis. ICU length of stay (LOS) was longer in 
patients with complex stenosis. There was no statistically significant 
difference between TS classes in terms of ICU mortality (p = 0.466), 1-year 
mortality (p = 0.951), and mortality during follow-up (p = 0.608).
CONCLUSION: PITS is a challenging situation in ICU patients. In patients with a 
preliminary diagnosis of PITS, bronchoscopy should be performed without delay, 
and it should be known that interventional bronchoscopy is not only a diagnostic 
tool but an effective strategy in treatment management after the diagnosis is 
finalised. The advantage of interventional bronchoscopy is that it alleviates 
symptoms that necessitate hospitalisation in the ICU and eliminates the need for 
ICU of patients.

unit: A retrospective cohort study based on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database.

Medical College Beijing China.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the epidemiological 
characteristics of very elderly patients (aged over 80 years) with cancer 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and to elucidate the association 
between Acute Physiology Score III (APS-III) and 28-day mortality.
METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients 
aged 80 years and above were assigned to three groups: non-cancer group, 
non-metastatic cancer group, and metastatic cancer group, based on their cancer 
diagnosis and its extent, Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed among these 
patient groups. Furthermore, patients were divided into a survival group and a 
non-survival group based on their 28-day survival status after ICU admission. 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to 
detect the risk factors for 28-day mortality among these patients. Additionally, 
this investigation sought to establish a dose-response relationship by exploring 
the graded association between APS-III scores and the 28-day mortalities among 
patients diagnosed with cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 42,037 medical records were screened, from which 11,461 
elderly patients aged over 80 years were included, comprising 1020 (8.90%) with 
non-metastatic cancer, 537 (4.68%) with metastatic cancer, and 9904 (86.41%) 
without cancer. Significant differences in 28-day mortality were observed 
between both the non-metastatic and metastatic cancer groups compared to the 
non-cancer group (20.98% and 22.35% vs. 15.75%, p < 0.001). However, no 
statistically significant difference was detected in the 28-day mortality rate 
when comparing the non-metastatic cancer group directly with the metastatic 
cancer group (20.98% vs. 22.35%, p = 0.576). Univariate analysis revealed 
significant differences (p < 0.001) in age, gender, BMI, aCCI excluding cancer 
point, ventilation, presence of cancer, and status of metastatic cancer between 
the survival and non-survival groups. In the multivariate logistic regression, 
the odds ratio (OR) for ventilation was found to be 2.154 (95% CI: 1.799-2.578), 
cancer conferred an OR of 1.499 (95% CI: 1.137-1.975), metastatic cancer showed 
an OR of 1.171 (95% CI: 0.745-1.841), APS-III showed an OR of 1.038 (95% CI: 
1.034-1.042). A dose-response relationship was observed, demonstrating that when 
the APS-III score exceeded 80 points, the 28-day mortality rate surpassed 50% 
among the very elderly cancer patients in ICU.
CONCLUSIONS: More than one-tenth of critically ill very elderly patients 
admitted to the ICU are diagnosed with cancer. Among ICU patients, those with 
cancer face a short-term mortality risk approximately 1.5 times higher than 
those without a cancer diagnosis. Interestingly, while our findings do not 
indicate an escalated mortality risk due to metastasis within the cancer patient 
cohort, the presence of cancer itself remains a significant factor influencing 
ICU mortality rates in this very elderly population.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients 
admitted to the intensive care unit with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2, 
comparing them according to successive waves, and to identify prognostic factors 
for morbidity and mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center retrospective observational 
descriptive study was conducted from March 10, 2020, to October 17, 2021. All 
adult patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia presenting acute respiratory 
failure were included. COVID 19 diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR testing of 
respiratory specimens. The primary endpoint was ICU mortality. Secondary 
endpoints were the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 437 patients were included of whom 282 (65%) 
patients were ventilated for 9 [5;20] days. Among the studied population, 38% 
were treated for one or more episodes of VAP, and 22 (5%) for bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis. ICU mortality was 26% in the first wave, then fell and stabilized 
at around 10% in subsequent waves (p = 0.02). Increased age, Charlson index, 
SOFA score and lactatemia on admission were predictive of mortality. Survival at 
90 days was 85% (95% CI 82-88) and was unaffected by the presence of VAP. 
However, the occurrence of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis increased mortality to 
36%.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed mortality in the lower range of those 
previously reported. Risk factors for mortality mainly included age and previous 
comorbidities. The prognosis of these critically ill Covid 19 patients improved 
over the four waves, underlining the likely beneficial effect of vaccination and 
dexamethasone.

The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score was developed to overcome the 
limitations of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) when assessing individuals with 
impaired consciousness. We sought to review the evidence regarding the 
predictive validity of the GCS and FOUR score in intensive care unit (ICU) 
settings. This review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023420528). 
Systematic searches of CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase were undertaken. Prospective 
observational studies were included if both GCS and FOUR score were assessed in 
adults during ICU admission and if mortality and/or validated functional outcome 
measure scores were collected. Studies were excluded if they exclusively 
investigated patients with traumatic brain injury. Screening, data extraction, 
and quality assessment using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool were 
conducted by two reviewers. Twenty studies of poor to moderate quality were 
included. Many studies only included patients with neurological illness and 
excluded sedated patients, despite high proportions of intubated patients. The 
FOUR score achieved higher area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve values for mortality prediction compared with the GCS, and the FOUR score 
achieved significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve values for predictions of ICU mortality. Both coma scales showed similar 
accuracy in predicting ""unfavorable"" functional outcome. The FOUR score appeared 
to be more responsive than the GCS in the ICU, as most patients with a GCS score 
of 3 obtained FOUR scores between 1 and 8 due to preserved brainstem function. 
The FOUR score may be superior to the GCS for predicting mortality in ICU 
settings. Further adequately powered studies with clear, reliable methods for 
assessment of index and outcome scores are required to clarify the predictive 
performance of both coma scales in ICUs. Inclusion of sedated patients may 
improve generalizability of findings in general ICU populations.

BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients face higher risks of Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection and co-infections, leading to a 
possibility of high disease severity and poor outcomes. Conversely, 
immunosuppression can mitigate the excessive inflammatory response induced by 
the virus, potentially reducing disease severity. This study aims to investigate 
the prognostic differences and early inflammatory response characteristics in 
various types of immunocompromised patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), summarize their clinical 
features, and explore potential mechanisms.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on critically ill COVID-19 
patients admitted to the ICU of 59 medical centers in mainland China during the 
Omicron outbreak from November 2022 to February 2023. Patients were categorized 
into two groups based on their immunosuppression status: immunocompromised and 
immunocompetent. Immunocompromised patients were further subdivided by etiology 
into cancer patients, solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, and other 
immunocompromised groups, with immunocompetent patients serving as controls. The 
mortality rates, respiratory support, complications, and early inflammatory 
cytokine dynamics upon ICU admission among different populations were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 2030 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were 
included, with 242 in the immunocompromised group and 1788 in the 
immunocompetent group. Cancer patients had a higher median age of 69 years (IQR 
59, 77), while SOT patients were generally younger and had less severe illness 
upon ICU admission, with a median APACHE II score of 12.0 (IQR 8.0, 20.0). 
Cancer patients had a twofold increased risk of death (OR = 2.02, 95% CI 
1.18-3.46, P = 0.010) compared to immunocompetent patients. SOT and cancer 
patients exhibited higher C-reactive protein and serum ferritin levels than the 
immunocompetent group in their early days of ICU admission. The CD8+ T cells 
dynamics were inversely correlated in cancer and SOT patients, with 
Interleukin-6 levels consistently lower in the SOT group compared to both 
immunocompetent and cancer patients.
CONCLUSION: Critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU exhibit 
distinct clinical outcomes based on their immunosuppression status, with cancer 
patients facing the highest mortality rate due to variations in inflammatory 
responses linked to their immunosuppression mechanisms. Monitoring dynamic 
changes in inflammatory markers and immune cells, particularly CD8+ T 
lymphocytes and IL-6, may offer valuable prognostic insights for these patients.

BACKGROUND: Various social determinants of health have been established as 
significant risk factors for COVID-19 transmission, prevalence, incidence, and 
mortality. Area deprivation index (ADI, a composite score made up of 
educational, housing, and poverty markers) is an accepted multidimensional 
social determinants of health measure. Little is known about how structural 
social determinants of health before hospitalization, including ADI, may affect 
mortality related to COVID-19 in critically ill patients.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of ADI with intensive care unit (ICU) 
mortality in patients with COVID-19 and compare its predictive power with that 
of clinical factors.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of critically ill adults with 
COVID-19 in 3 hospitals within a single health system. Multivariable logistic 
regression models (adjusted for demographic and clinical variables) were used to 
examine the association of ADI with ICU mortality.
RESULTS: Data from 1784 patients hospitalized from 2020 to 2022 were analyzed. 
In multivariable models, no association was found between national ADI and ICU 
mortality. Notable factors associated with ICU mortality included treatment 
year, age, van Walraven weighted score, invasive mechanical ventilation, and 
body mass index.
CONCLUSION: In this study, clinical factors were more predictive of mortality 
than ADI and other social determinants of health. The influence of ADI may be 
most relevant before hospital admission. These findings could serve as a 
foundation for shaping targeted public health strategies and hospital 
interventions, enhancing care delivery, and potentially contributing to better 
outcomes in future pandemics.

BACKGROUND: Anthropometric measurements are crucial in pediatric critical care, 
but the impact of height on ICU outcomes is underexplored despite a substantial 
number of short-for-age children in ICUs. Previous studies suggest that short 
stature increases the risk of poor clinical outcomes. This study examines the 
relationship between short stature and ICU outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a Japanese nationwide 
database (the Japanese Intensive Care Patient Database; JIPAD), which included 
pediatric patients under 16 years admitted to ICUs from April 2015 to March 
2020. Height standard deviation scores (SD scores) were calculated based on age 
and sex. Short-stature patients were defined as height SD score <  - 2. The 
primary outcome was all-cause ICU mortality, and the secondary outcome was the 
length of stay in ICU.
RESULTS: Out of 6,377 pediatric patients, 27.2% were classified as having short 
stature. The ICU mortality rate was significantly higher in the short-stature 
group compared to the normal-height group (3.6% vs. 1.4%, p < 0.01). 
Multivariable logistic regression showed that short stature was independently 
associated with increased ICU mortality (OR = 2.73, 95% CI 1.81-4.11). 
Additionally, the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards model indicated that short 
stature was associated with a lower chance of ICU discharge for each additional 
day (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.90, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Short stature is a significant risk factor for increased ICU 
mortality and prolonged ICU stay in critically ill children. Height should be 
considered in risk assessments and management strategies in pediatric intensive 
care to improve outcomes.

Background: Bacterial/fungal coinfections (COIs) are associated with antibiotic 
overuse, poor outcomes such as prolonged ICU stay, and increased mortality. Our 
aim was to develop machine learning-based predictive models to identify 
respiratory bacterial or fungal coinfections upon ICU admission. Methods: We 
conducted a secondary analysis of two prospective multicenter cohort studies 
with confirmed influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and COVID-19. Multiple logistic 
regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) were used to identify factors associated 
with BFC in the overall population and in each subgroup (influenza and 
COVID-19). The performance of these models was assessed by the area under the 
ROC curve (AUC) and out-of-bag (OOB) methods for MLR and RF, respectively. 
Results: Of the 8902 patients, 41.6% had influenza and 58.4% had SARS-CoV-2 
infection. The median age was 60 years, 66% were male, and the crude ICU 
mortality was 25%. BFC was observed in 14.2% of patients. Overall, the 
predictive models showed modest performances, with an AUC of 0.68 (MLR) and OOB 
36.9% (RF). Specific models did not show improved performance. However, age, 
procalcitonin, CRP, APACHE II, SOFA, and shock were factors associated with BFC 
in most models. Conclusions: Machine learning models do not adequately predict 
the presence of co-infection in critically ill patients with pandemic virus 
infection. However, the presence of factors such as advanced age, elevated 
procalcitonin or CPR, and high severity of illness should alert clinicians to 
the need to rule out this complication on admission to the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Systemic corticosteroid has been recommended for the treatment of 
severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). 
Little is known about the use of systemic corticosteroid in patients admitted to 
intensive care units (ICU) since most of previous trials excluded these 
critically ill patients.
METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study based on the Medical Information 
Mart in Intensive Care-IV database. Patients with AECOPD in ICUs were included. 
Patients in the exposure group should be intravenously administrated with 
methylprednisolone or treated with oral prednisone within 24 h after ICU 
admission. The propensity score matching and multivariable analyses were used to 
adjust for covariates. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary 
outcomes included ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, the duration of ICU 
stay, and mechanical ventilation. Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome were 
performed according to age, sex, type of corticosteroid, type of ICU admission, 
type of mechanical ventilation, and co-morbidities/complications.
RESULTS: The entire cohort and the matched cohort included 763 and 412 patients, 
respectively. In the matched cohort, the use of systemic corticosteroid had no 
impact on 28-day mortality (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.61-1.64, P = 1.000). The results 
kept consistent in all subgroups. Additionally, systemic corticosteroid showed 
no benefits on ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, the length of ICU stay, and 
the duration of mechanical ventilation.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not support routine use of systemic 
corticosteroid in patients with AECOPD admitted to ICUs.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor produced by endothelial cells 
and cleared from circulating blood mainly in the pulmonary vasculature. In a 
healthy pulmonary circulation, the rate of local production of ET-1 is less than 
its rate of clearance. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether the 
abnormal pulmonary circulatory handling of ET-1 relates to poor clinical 
outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To this end, central venous and systemic 
arterial ET-1 plasma levels were simultaneously measured on Days 1 and 3 
following ICU admission in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with ARDS 
(COVID-19 ARDS, N = 18). Central venous and systemic arterial ET-1 plasma levels 
were also measured in two distinct SARS-CoV-2-negative mechanically ventilated 
critically ill patient groups, matched for age, sex, and critical illness 
severity, with ARDS (non-COVID-19 ARDS, N = 14) or without ARDS (non-COVID-19 
non-ARDS, N = 20). Upon ICU admission, COVID-19-induced ARDS patients had higher 
systemic arterial and central venous ET-1 levels compared to the non-COVID-19 
ARDS and non-COVID-19 non-ARDS patients (p < 0.05), yet a normal systemic 
arterial:central venous (A:V) ET-1 ratio [0.63 (0.49-1.02)], suggesting that 
pulmonary ET-1 clearance is intact in these patients. On the other hand, the 
non-COVID-19 ARDS patients demonstrated abnormal ET-1 handling [A:V ET-1 ratio 
1.06 (0.93-1.20)], while the non-COVID-19 non-ARDS group showed normal ET-1 
handling [0.79 (0.52-1.11)]. On Day 3, the A:V ratio in all three groups was <1. 
When the COVID-19 ARDS patients were divided based on 28-day ICU mortality, 
while their systemic arterial and central venous levels did not differ, the A:V 
ET-1 ratio was statistically significantly higher upon ICU admission in the 
non-survivors [0.95 (0.78-1.34)] compared to the survivors [0.57 (0.48-0.92), p 
= 0.027]. Our results highlight the potential importance of ET-1 as both a 
biomarker and a therapeutic target in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The 
elevated A:V ET-1 ratio in non-survivors suggests that the early disruption of 
pulmonary ET-1 handling may be a key marker of poor prognosis.

PURPOSES: Since 2016, the World Health Organization has recommended universal 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all people living with Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus (PLHIV). This recommendation may have influenced the characteristics and 
outcomes of PLHIV admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This study aims to 
identify changes in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of PLHIV 
admitted to the ICU, and their short- and medium-term outcomes before and after 
the implementation of universal ART (periods 2006-2015 and 2016-2019).
METHODS: This retrospective, observational, single-center study included all 
adult PLHIV admitted to the ICU of a University Hospital in Barcelona from 2006 
to 2019.
RESULTS: The study included 502 admissions involving 428 patients, predominantly 
men (75%) with a median (P25-P75) age of 47.5 years (39.7-53.9). Ninety-one 
percent were diagnosed with HIV before admission, with 82% under ART and 60% 
admitted from the emergency department. In 2016-2019, there were more patients 
on ART pre-admission, reduced needs for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) 
and fewer in-ICU complications. ICU mortality was also lower (14% vs 7%). 
Predictors of in-ICU mortality included acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
defining event (ADE)-related admissions, ICU complications, higher SOFA scores, 
IMV and renal replacement therapy (RRT) requirement. ART use during ICU 
admission was protective. Higher SOFA scores, admission from hospital wards, and 
more comorbidities predicted one-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The in-ICU mortality of critically ill PLHIV has decreased in 
recent years, likely due to changes in patient characteristics. Pre- and ICU 
admission features remain the primary predictors of short- and medium-term 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, numerous studies on potential factors 
contributing to ventilation-induced lung injury have been carried out. 
Mechanical power has been pointed out as the parameter that encloses all 
ventilation-induced lung injury-contributing factors. However, studies conducted 
to date provide data regarding mechanical power during the early hours of 
mechanical ventilation that may not accurately reflect the impact of power 
throughout the period of mechanical ventilatory support on intensive care unit 
mortality.
METHODS: Retrospective observational study conducted at a single center in 
Spain. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit, > o = 18 years of age, and 
ventilated for over 24 h were included. We extracted the mechanical power values 
throughout the entire mechanical ventilation in controlled modes period from the 
clinical information system every 2 min. First, we calculate the cutoff-point 
for mechanical power beyond which there was a greater change in the probability 
of death. After, the sum of time values above the safe cut-off point was 
calculated to obtain the value in hours. We analyzed if the number of hours the 
patient was under ventilation with a mechanical power above the safe threshold 
was associated with intensive care unit mortality, invasive mechanical 
ventilation days, and intensive care unit length of stay. We repeated the 
analysis in different subgroups based on the degree of hypoxemia and in patients 
with SARS CoV-2 pneumonia.
RESULTS: The cut-off point of mechanical power at with there is a higher 
increase in intensive care unit mortality was 18 J/min. The greater the number 
of hours patients were under mechanical power > 18 J/min the higher the 
intensive care unit mortality in all the study population, in patients with SARS 
CoV-2 pneumonia and in mild to moderate hypoxemic respiratory failure. The risk 
of death in the intensive care unit increases 0.1% for each hour with mechanical 
power exceeding 18 J/min. The number of hours with mechanical power > 18 J/min 
also affected the days of invasive mechanical ventilation and intensive care 
unit length of stay.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of hours with mechanical power > 18 J/min is associated 
with mortality in the intensive care unit in critically ill patients. Continuous 
monitoring of mechanical power in controlled modes using an automated clinical 
information system could alert the clinician to this risk.

PURPOSE: There is a paucity of data from sub-Saharan Africa describing Severe 
Community Acquired Pneumonia (SCAP), a condition with significant morbidity and 
mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centre, observational 
study of consecutive patients with SCAP admitted to the ICU at Charlotte Maxeke 
Johannesburg Academic Hospital, in South Africa between 1 July 2007 and 31 May 
2019. Pneumonia was categorised as community-acquired if there had been no 
hospitalization in the preceding 2 weeks.
RESULTS: We identified 931 patients, (median age 37 [IQR 30-48] years), with the 
predominant co-morbidity being HIV co-infection (77.1 %). The median CURB-65 and 
APACHE II scores were 3 (IQR 2-3) and 18 (IQR 14-23) respectively, and most 
patients had multilobar consolidation on chest X-ray. Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
was the most common aetiology, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The latter, 
and Pneumocystis jirovecii were more common amongst survivors and non-survivors, 
respectively. ICU mortality was 50.1 % and 85 % of patients required 
ventilation, mostly invasive mechanical ventilation. Ventilated patients and 
those requiring inotropic support and/or dialysis were more likely to die.
CONCLUSION: We have described a cohort of patients with SCAP, with a 
comprehensive overview of all putative microbiological causes, which to our 
knowledge, is the largest reported in the literature.

The Brazilian Amazon is a vast area with limited health care resources. To 
assess the epidemiology of critically ill acute kidney injury (AKI) patients in 
this area, a prospective cohort study of 1029 adult patients of the three 
intensive care units (ICUs) of Rio Branco city, the capital of Acre state, were 
evaluated from February 2014 to February 2016. The incidence of AKI was 53.3%. 
Risk factors for AKI included higher age, nonsurgical patients, admission to the 
ICU from the ward, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 
(APACHE) II scores at ICU admission, and positive fluid balance > 1500 ml/24 
hours in the days before AKI development in the ICU, with aOR of 1.3 (95% CI 
1.03-1.23), 1.47 (95% CI 1.07-2.03), 1.96 (95% CI 1.40-2.74), 1.05 (95% CI 
1.03-1.08) for each unit increase, and 1.62 (95% CI 1.16-2.26), respectively. 
AKI was associated with higher ICU mortality (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.29-3.18). AKI 
mortality was independently associated with higher age, nonsurgical patients, 
sepsis at ICU admission, presence of shock or use of vasoactive drugs, 
mechanical ventilation and mean positive fluid balance in the ICU > 1500 ml/24 
hours, both during ICU follow-up, with aOR 1.27 (95% CI 1.14-1.43) for each 
10-year increase, 1.64 (95% CI 1.07-2.52), 2.35 (95% CI 1.14-4.83), 1.88 (95% CI 
1.03-3.44), 6.73 (95% CI 4.08-11.09), 2.31 (95% CI 1.52-3.53), respectively. 
Adjusted hazard ratios for AKI mortality 30 and 31-180 days after ICU discharge 
were 3.13 (95% CI 1.84-5.31) and 1.69 (95% CI 0.99-2.90), respectively. AKI 
incidence was strikingly high among critically ill patients in the Brazilian 
Amazon. The AKI etiology, risk factors and outcomes were similar to those 
described in high-income countries, but mortality rates were higher.

Background and objective Sepsis and septic shock are major healthcare issues in 
surgical patients admitted to the surgery ward or ICU, affecting millions of 
people worldwide annually, with a mortality rate between one in three and one in 
six of those affected. The incidence and mortality of sepsis vary greatly by 
region, with the highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, South Asia, 
East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Of all sepsis cases in 2017, 33.1 million people 
suffered from ill health due to underlying infectious diseases, and 15.8 million 
suffered from underlying injuries or non-communicable diseases.  Methods This 
prospective observational study was conducted at the Jimma University Medical 
Centre (JUMC) in Jimma town in southwest Ethiopia, from April 2023 to October 
2023. All surgical patients aged ≥15 years who presented with or developed 
septic shock at the Jimma University Medical Centre were included. Results The 
study involved a total of 61 patients. The median age of the patients was 45 
years [interquartile range (IQR): 40-60 years], and 77% (n=47) of the patients 
were male. The most frequent source of infection in this study was 
community-acquired infection (83.3%, n=49). The most common focus of sepsis was 
the intra-abdominal infection of the digestive system (82%, n=50). Lactate level 
testing and blood cultures before administering antibiotics were not done for 
all septic shock patients. Source control surgery was performed in 52.5% (n=32) 
of patients after developing septic shock, and 84.4% (n=27) of surgeries were 
performed within 24 hours. The 30-day mortality rate was 80.3%, with an ICU 
mortality rate of 78.94%. The median length of stay in the ICU was three days 
(IQR: 1-5 days), and the median length of hospital stay was six days (IQR: 2-15 
days). Conclusions The mortality rate in our cohort was higher compared to that 
in studies from high-income and low-income countries. There was poor adherence 
and compliance with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) (the one-hour bundle) 
guidelines. The length of stay in hospitals and ICUs was lower compared to 
studies from high-income countries due to the high early mortality rates.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the correlation between hyperglycemia at 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and the incidence of acute kidney injury 
(AKI) in patients after cardiac surgery.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, in which clinical data were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database. Adults (≥18 years) in the database who were admitted to the 
cardiovascular intensive care unit after cardiac surgery were enrolled. The 
primary outcome was the incidence of AKI within 7 days following ICU admission. 
Secondary outcomes included ICU mortality, hospital mortality, ICU length of 
stay, and the 28-day and 90-day mortality. Multivariable Cox regression analysis 
was used to assess the association between ICU-admission hyperglycemia and AKI 
incidence within 7 days of ICU admission. Different adjustment strategies were 
used to adjust for potential confounders. Patients were divided into three 
groups according to their highest blood glucose levels recorded within 24 h of 
ICU admission: no hyperglycemia (<140 mg/dL), mild hyperglycemia (140-200 
mg/dL), and severe hyperglycemia (≥200 mg/dL).
RESULTS: Of the 6905 included patients, 2201 (31.9%) were female, and the median 
(IQR) age was 68.2 (60.1-75.9) years. In all, 1836 (26.6%) patients had severe 
hyperglycemia. The incidence of AKI within 7 days of ICU admission, ICU 
mortality, and hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with 
severe admission hyperglycemia than those with mild hyperglycemia or no 
hyperglycemia (80.3% vs. 73.6% and 61.2%, respectively; 2.8% vs. 0.9% and 1.9%, 
respectively; and 3.4% vs. 1.2% and 2.5%, respectively; all P <0.001). Severe 
hyperglycemia was a risk factor for 7-day AKI (Model 1: hazard ratio 
[HR]=1.4809, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3126 to 1.6707; Model 2: HR=1.1639, 
95% CI: 1.0176 to 1.3313; Model 3: HR=1.2014, 95% CI: 1.0490 to 1.3760; all P 
<0.050). Patients with normal glucose levels (glucose levels <140 mg/dL) had a 
higher 28-day mortality rate than those with severe hyperglycemia (glucose 
levels ≥200 mg/dL) (4.0% vs. 3.8%, P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In post-cardiac surgery patients, severe hyperglycemia within 24 h 
of ICU admission increases the risk of 7-day AKI, ICU mortality, and hospital 
mortality. Clinicians should be extra cautious regarding AKI among patients with 
hyperglycemia at ICU admission after cardiac surgery.

BACKGROUND: Stress hyperglycemia is now more common in intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients and is strongly associated with poor prognosis. Whether this 
association exists in critically ill patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) is 
unknown. This study investigated the prognostic relationship of stress 
hyperglycemia on critically ill patients with CS.
METHODS: We included 393 critically ill patients with CS from the MIMIC IV 
database in this study and categorized the patients into four groups based on 
quartiles of Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR). We assessed the correlation 
between SHR and mortality using restricted cubic spline analysis and Cox 
proportional hazards models. The primary outcomes observed were ICU mortality 
and hospitalization mortality.
RESULTS: The mean age of the entire study population was 68 years, of which 30% 
were male (118 cases). There was no significant difference between the four 
groups in terms of age, gender, BMI, and vital signs (P>0.05). There was an 
increasing trend in the levels of lactate (lac), white blood cell count (WBC), 
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), glucose and Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) from 
group Q1 to group Q2, with the greatest change in patients in group Q4 (P<0.05) 
and the patients in group Q4 had the highest use of mechanical ventilation, the 
longest duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay. After 
adjusting for confounders, SHR was found to be strongly associated with patient 
ICU mortality, showing a U-shaped relationship.
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with CS, stress hyperglycemia assessed by 
SHR was significantly associated with patient ICU mortality.

BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a life-threatening disease burdened by a 
mortality up to 50%. The epidemiology has changed with non-ischemic aetiologies 
being predominant although data was mainly derived from patients admitted to 
dedicated acute cardiac care. We report the epidemiology and outcome of patients 
with CS admitted to general intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: Prospective multicentric epidemiological study including 314 general 
ICU adhering to the GiViTI Nationwide registry from 2011 to 2018, excluding 
cardiac arrest. The primary endpoint of the study was mortality. The association 
between clinical factors and mortality was evaluated using a logistic regression 
model. The Odds Ratios of the covariates quantify their association with 
mortality during hospitalization.
RESULTS: 11052 patients admitted to general ICU (incidence 2.17%; median age 72 
(IQR [66-81]), 38.7% were women) with CS were included. Fourthy-seven percent of 
patients had more than 3 organ insufficiency at the time of admission. The most 
common CS aetiologies were: left heart failure LHF- 5247-47.5%), acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI - 3612-32.6%); right heart failure (RHF- 515-4.6%) 
and biventricular failure (532- 4.8%). 85.5% were mechanically ventilated during 
the ICU hospitalization. The overall ICU mortality was 44.8%, increasing to 
53.4% during the hospitalization in the index hospital and to 54.3% at the 
latest hospital. RHF-CS patients exhibited the highest mortality risk (OR: 1.19 
95% CI [0.94 - 1.50]; p < 0.001), followed by biventricular-CS OR 1.04 95% CI 
[0.82-1.32]. Respiratory failure (OR 1.13 [95%CI 1.08-1.19]), coagulation 
disorder (1.17 (95% CI 1.1-1.24), renal dysfunction (OR 1.55 [95% CI 1.50-1.61] 
and neurological alteration (OR 1.45 [95% CI 1.39-1.50]) were associated with 
worsen outcome along with severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 70 mmHg- 
OR 2.35 95% CI [2.06-2.67]), increasing age (OR 2.21 95% CI [2.01-2.42] and 
longer ICU stay prior to admission (2-fold increase for each 4.7 days).
CONCLUSIONS: In the general ICU the aetiology of CS, excluding cardiac arrest, 
remains characterized mostly by LHF with RHF-CS burdened by higher mortality. 
Multiorgan failure at admission and longer hospital stay before ICU admission 
predispose to worsen outcome.

This study delves into the correlation between the triglyceride glucose-body 
mass index (TyG-BMI) index upon hospital admission and clinical outcomes among 
this patient population. We investigated the association between TyG-BMI at 
hospital admission and clinical outcomes in this patient group, and analyzed 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, 
identifying acute pancreatitis (AP) patients admitted to ICUs and stratifying 
them by TyG-BMI quartiles. We assessed the relationship between TyG-BMI and 
mortality (both in-hospital and ICU) using Cox proportional hazards regression 
and restricted cubic splines. The cohort included 419 patients, average age 
56.34 ± 16.62 years, with a majority being male (61.58%). Hospital and ICU 
mortality rates were 11.93% and 7.16%, respectively. Higher TyG-BMI was 
positively correlated with increased all-cause mortality. Patients in the 
highest TyG-BMI quartile had significantly greater risks of in-hospital and ICU 
mortality. An S-shaped curve in the spline analysis indicated a threshold effect 
at a TyG-BMI of 243 for increased in-hospital mortality risk. TyG-BMI is a 
reliable predictor of both in-hospital and ICU mortality in severely ill AP 
patients, suggesting its utility in enhancing risk assessment and guiding 
clinical interventions for this vulnerable population.

BACKGROUND: Status Epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency with high 
mortality rate that often requires admission in Intensive Care Units (ICU). 
Several factors of worse outcome have been identified in prior studies. The aim 
of our study was to determine the mortality in ICU and in the ward in patients 
with SE admitted to an ICU and to identify risk factors of mortality.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with SE treated in the 
ICU of a tertiary medical center between 2015 and 2020. The primary outcome 
measure was mortality in the ICU (ICU death) or in the ward after ICU discharge 
(post-ICU death).
RESULTS: 252 patients were included, with a mean age of 63 (±16) years and 127 
males (50 %). 58 died in the ICU, 27 died in the ward. Overall mortality was 
associated with a higher burden of comorbidities (OR:1.28, p < 0.001), the use 
of vasopressors (OR: 5.65, p < 0.001) and a higher burden of ICU complications 
(OR: 1.32, p = 0.002). Mortality rate was higher in more severe SE episodes 
(nonconvulsive, acute symptomatic and refractoriness. In-ICU mortality was 
associated with the use of vasopressors (OR: 7.92, p<0.001) and mechanical 
ventilation (OR: 3.13, p = 0.031), the length of in-ICU stay (OR: 0.91, p = 
0.005) and a higher burden of ICU complications (OR: 1.37, p = 0.001). Compared 
to post-ICU deaths, ICU deaths also had higher Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score on ICU admission (p<0.001). Post-ICU mortality was 
associated with a higher burden of comorbidities (OR: 1.34, p<0.001), a higher 
burden of complications after ICU-discharge (OR: 1.33, p = 0.01), and more often 
refractory SE episode (OR: 2.63, p = 0.01). Compared to survivors, post-ICU 
deaths experienced mostly infectious and respiratory complications, after 
ICU-discharge.
CONCLUSION: Death was more frequent in more severe SE episodes: non convulsive 
semiology, acute etiology, and refractoriness. In-ICU, post-ICU and all-cause 
mortality in patients with SE admitted to an ICU are all associated with a 
higher burden of comorbidities, which are non-modifiable prognostic factors, but 
also with a higher burden of complications, some of which are preventable, such 
as respiratory infections.

BACKGROUND: Age is a significant consideration for intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission. However, the reported associations between increasing age and 
mortality vary across studies, and data in the local context of Malaysia are 
lacking. The objective of the present study was to determine the impact of 
increasing age on ICU mortality.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of ICU patients was conducted between 
January 2020 and November 2023 at a university hospital in Malaysia. Patients 
were classified into two categories according to age (years) and into four 
groups according to National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings 
(MeSH): young adult (19-24), adult (25-44), middle age (45-64), and elderly 
(≥65). The Cochran-Armitage test for trend and Cox proportional hazards 
regression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of increasing age on 
ICU mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1,661 patients was analyzed. The Cochran-Armitage test 
showed a significant positive association between ICU mortality rate and age 
group (Z=-4.86, P<0.01) or MeSH category (Z=-5.36, P<0.01). After adjusting for 
other confounders, the strongest predictor for ICU mortality in the Cox 
proportional hazards regression analyses was age, with the elderly age group 
having the highest adjusted hazard ratio of 4.777 (95% CI, 1.128-20.231; 
P=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Age had a significant impact on ICU mortality in our cohort of 
critically ill patients.

BACKGROUND: Hypothermia is a relatively common complication in patients 
receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). However, few studies have 
reported the factors associated with hypothermia.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in five intensive care units 
(ICUs) to evaluate the incidence of hypothermia and the predictive factors for 
developing hypothermia during CRRT, with hypothermia defined as a time-weighted 
average temperature <36 °C.
RESULTS: From January 2020 to December 2021, 300 patients were enrolled. 
Hypothermia developed in 23.7% of them within the first 24 hours after CRRT 
initiation. Compared to non-hypothermic patients, hypothermic patients were 
older and had lower body weight, more frequent acidemia, and higher ICU and 
30-day mortality rates. In the multivariate analysis, age >70 years (odds ratio 
[OR], 2.59; 95% CI, 1.38-4.98; P=0.004), higher positive fluid balance on the 
day before CRRT (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.22; P=0.02), and CRRT dose (OR, 1.003; 
95% CI, 1.00-1.01; P=0.04) were significantly associated with hypothermia. 
Conversely, a higher body weight was independently associated with mitigated 
risk of hypothermia (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.97; P=0.01). Moreover, a higher 
coefficient of variance of temperature was associated with greater ICU mortality 
(OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.13-1.78; P=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Hypothermia during CRRT is a relatively common occurrence, and 
factors associated with hypothermia onset in the first 24 hours include older 
age, lower body weight, higher positive fluid balance on the day before CRRT, 
and higher CRRT dose. Greater temperature variability was associated with 
increased ICU mortality.

INTRODUCTION: The proportion of very elderly patients in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) is expected to rise. Furthermore, patients are likely more prone to suffer 
a cardiac arrest (CA) event within the ICU. The occurrence of intensive care 
unit cardiac arrest (ICU-CA) is associated with high mortality. To date, the 
incidence of ICU-CA and its clinical impact on outcome in the very old (≥ 90 
years) patients treated is unknown.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive critically ill patients ≥ 90 
years admitted to the ICU of a tertiary care university hospital in Hamburg 
(Germany). All patients suffering ICU-CA were included and CA characteristics 
and functional outcome was assessed. Clinical course and outcome were assessed 
and compared between the subgroups of patients with and without ICU-CA.
RESULTS: 1,108 critically ill patients aged ≥ 90 years were admitted during the 
study period. The median age was 92.3 (91.0-94.2) years and 67% (n = 747) were 
female. 2% (n = 25) of this cohort suffered ICU-CA after a median duration 0.5 
(0.2-3.2) days of ICU admission. The presumed cause of ICU-CA was cardiac in 64% 
(n = 16). The median resuscitation time was 10 (2-15) minutes and the initial 
rhythm was shockable in 20% (n = 5). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) 
could be achieved in 68% (n = 17). The cause of ICU admission was primarily 
medical in the total cohort (ICU-CA: 48% vs. No ICU-CA: 34%, p = 0.13), surgical 
- planned (ICU-CA: 32% vs. No ICU-CA: 37%, p = 0.61) and surgical - 
unplanned/emergency (ICU-CA: 43% vs. No ICU-CA: 28%, p = 0.34). The median 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 2 (1-3) points for patients with ICU-CA and 
1 (0-2) for patients without ICU-CA (p = 0.54). Patients with ICU-CA had a 
higher disease severity according to SAPS II (ICU-CA: 54 vs. No ICU-CA: 36 
points, p < 0.001). Patients with ICU-CA had a higher rate of mechanically 
ventilation (ICU-CA: 64% vs. No ICU-CA: 34%, p < 0.01) and required vasopressor 
therapy more often (ICU-CA: 88% vs. No ICU-CA: 41%, p < 0.001). The ICU and 
in-hospital mortality was 88% (n = 22) and 100% (n = 25) in patients with ICU-CA 
compared to 17% (n = 179) and 28% (n = 306) in patients without ICU-CA. The 
mortality rate for patients with ICU-CA was observed to be 88% (n = 22) in the 
ICU and 100% (n = 25) in-hospital. In contrast, patients without ICU-CA had an 
in-ICU mortality rate of 17% (n = 179) and an in-hospital mortality rate of 28% 
(n = 306) (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of ICU-CA in very elderly patients is rare but 
associated with high mortality. Providing CPR in this cohort did not lead to 
long-term survival at our centre. Very elderly patients admitted to the ICU 
likely benefit from supportive care only and should probably not be resuscitated 
due to poor chance of survival and ethical considerations. Providing 
personalized assurances that care will remain appropriate and in accordance with 
the patient's and family's wishes can optimise compassionate care while avoiding 
futile life-sustaining interventions.

BACKGROUND: Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a dependable indicator of insulin 
resistance, has been identified as a valid marker regarding multiple 
cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the correlation of TyG index with acute 
myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) remains 
uncertain. Our study aims for elucidating this relationship by comprehensively 
analyzing two large-scale cohorts.
METHODS: Utilizing records from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, the link between TyG and the 
incidence and prognosis of AMICS was assessed multicentrally and retrospectively 
by logistic and correlation models, as well as restricted cubic spline (RCS). 
Propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting 
(IPTW), and overlap weighting (OW) were employed to balance the potential 
confounders. Subgroup analyses were performed according to potential modifiers.
RESULTS: Overall, 5208 AMI patients, consisting of 375 developing CS were 
finally included. The TyG index exhibited an apparently higher level in AMI 
populations developing CS than in those who did not experienced CS [9.2 
(8.8-9.7) vs. 9.0 (8.5-9.5)], with a moderate discrimination ability to 
recognize AMICS from the general AMI (AUC: 0.604). Logistic analyses showed that 
the TyG index was significantly correlated with in-hospital and ICU mortality. 
RCS analysis demonstrated a linear link between elevated TyG and increased risks 
regarding in-hospital and ICU mortality in the AMICS population. An increased 
mortality risk remains evident in PSM-, OW- and IPTW-adjusted populations with 
higher TyG index who have undergone CS. Correlation analyses demonstrated an 
apparent link between TyG index and APS score. Subgroup analyses presented a 
stable link between elevated TyG and mortality particularly in older age, 
females, those who are overweight or hypertensive, as well as those without 
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TyG index was related to the incidence of CS following AMI 
and higher mortality risks in the population with AMICS. Our findings pointed a 
previously undisclosed role of TyG index in regard to AMICS that still requires 
further validation.

BACKGROUND: Sex differences in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2) susceptibility, illness severity, and hospital course are widely 
acknowledged. The effects of sex on outcomes experienced by patients with severe 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 
remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of sex on ICU mortality in patients with 
COVID-19 METHODS: This retrospective analysis of an international multi-center 
prospective observational database included adults admitted to ICU for treatment 
of acute COVID-19 between 1st January 2020 and 30th June 2022. The primary 
outcome was ICU mortality. Multivariable Cox regression was used to ascertain 
the hazard of death (Hazard Ratio=HR) adjusted for pre-selected covariates. The 
secondary outcome was sex differences in complications of COVID-19 during 
hospital stay.
RESULTS: Overall, 10,259 patients (3,314 females, 6,945 males) were included 
with a median age of 60 (interquartile range [IQR]=49-68) and 59 (IQR=49-67) 
years, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar between sexes. More 
females were non-smokers (65% vs. 44 %, p < 0.01) and obese (39% vs. 30 %, p < 
0.01), compared to males. Also, males received greater ICU intervention 
(mechanical ventilation, prone ventilation, vasopressors, and tracheostomy) than 
females. Males had a greater hazard of death (compared to females, HR=1.14; 95 % 
CI=1.02-1.26). Adjustment for complications during hospital stay did not alter 
the hazard of death (HR=1.16; 95 % CI=1.05-1.28). Males had a significantly 
elevated hazard of death among patients who received ECMO (HR=1.24; 95 % 
CI=1.01-1.53). Male sex was associated with cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 
[aOR]=1.37; 95 % CI=1.16-1.62) and PE (aOR=1.28; 95 % CI=1.06-1.55).
CONCLUSION: Among patients admitted to ICU for severe COVID-19, males 
experienced higher severity of illness and more frequent intervention than 
females. Ultimately, the hazard of death was moderately elevated in males 
compared to females despite greater PE and cardiac arrest.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVES: Acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence and outcome in 
Kuwait are unknown. Moreover, non-Kuwaitis, who represent 66% of the population, 
have lower income, and their access to public health services is restricted 
compared with Kuwaitis who have free full access.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational prospective multicenter cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adult inpatients with AKI in 7 public hospitals from 
January 1 to December 31, 2021.
EXPOSURE: AKI identified using Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes serum 
creatinine-based criteria.
OUTCOMES: For hospitalized patients with AKI, the outcomes included 30-day 
outcomes of mortality, need for dialysis, kidney recovery rates, and differences 
in outcomes between Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: A backward stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis 
was performed to assess possible independent risk factors for the outcomes.
RESULTS: We recruited 3,744 patients (mean age: 63 years; mean baseline 
estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]: 66.7 mL/min; non-Kuwaitis: 42.3%), 
representing 3.2% of hospitalizations and 19.5% of intensive care unit (ICU) 
admissions. Non-Kuwaitis were significantly younger (57.6 vs 66.9 years), with 
higher baseline eGFR (73.1 vs. 62 mL/min), more frequent community acquired AKI 
(53.8% vs 46.7%), and AKI in summer (34.7% vs 26.9%). Dialysis was provided to 
33.5% of patients, with a higher need for non-Kuwaitis (35.5% vs 32.1%). At 30 
days, 34.4% of patients died, representing 24.8% of hospital mortality and 59.8% 
of ICU mortality. No differences in mortality or kidney recovery were noted 
between Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis. Low eGFR did not affect the mortality rate.
LIMITATIONS: Observational nature and short follow-up period of 30 days only.
CONCLUSIONS: AKI was associated with high dialysis need and mortality. 
Non-Kuwaitis accounted for less cases despite representing 66% of the population 
because they were younger with higher baseline eGFR and fewer comorbid 
conditions. Non-Kuwaitis had higher rates of community acquired AKI and AKI in 
summer and a higher need for dialysis but had similar mortality and complete 
kidney recovery rates.

Plain Language Summary: Incidences of acute kidney injury (AKI), its management, 
and its outcomes are unknown in Kuwait. In addition, Kuwait has a large 
population of ethnically diverse expatriates who have lower income and do not 
enjoy the same level of access to public hospital services. We recruited 
hospitalized adults who have a diagnosis of AKI in several public hospitals in 
Kuwait. We analyzed characteristics, management, and outcomes data for more than 
3,700 patients and found that AKI affects 3.2% of hospitalized patients. AKI 
leads to high dialysis utilization rates and causes high mortality rates. 
Although more Kuwaitis were affected by AKI, the mortality rates for Kuwaitis 
and non-Kuwaitis were similar. Non-Kuwaitis were younger with better baseline 
kidney function and fewer chronic diseases than Kuwaitis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting 
28-day and 90-day mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients who have 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) coexisting with congestive heart 
failure (CHF).
METHODS: An extensive analysis was conducted on clinical data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, covering patients over 18 years 
old with both COPD and CHF, who were were first-time ICU admissions between 2008 
and 2019. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
method was employed to screen clinical features, with the final model being 
optimized using backward stepwise regression guided by the Akaike Information 
Criterion (AIC) to construct the nomogram. The predictive model's discrimination 
and clinical applicability were evaluated via receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves, calibration curves, the C-index, and decision curve analysi s 
(DCA).
RESULTS: This analysis was comprised of a total of 1948 patients. Patients were 
separated into developing and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio, with similar 
baseline characteristics between the two groups. The ICU mortality rates for the 
developing and verification cohorts were 20.8 % and 19.5 % at 28 days, 
respectively, and 29.4 % and 28.3 % at 90 days, respectively. The clinical 
characteristics retained by the backward stepwise regression include age, 
weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation 
(SpO2), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), lactate, partial thrombosis 
time (PTT), race, marital status, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), malignant 
cancer, acute kidney failure (AKF), pneumonia, immunosuppressive drugs, 
antiplatelet agents, vasoactive agents, acute physiology score III (APS III), 
Oxford acute severity of illness score (OASIS), and Charlson comorbidity index 
(CCI). We developed two separate models by assigning weighted scores to each 
independent risk factor: nomogram A excludes CCI but includes age, T2DM, and 
malignant cancer, while nomogram B includes only CCI, without age, T2DM, and 
malignant cancer. Based on the results of the AUC and C-index, this study 
selected nomogram A, which demonstrated better predictive performance, for 
subsequent validation. The calibration curve, C-index, and DCA results indicate 
that nomogram A has good accuracy in predicting short-term mortality and 
demonstrates better discriminative ability than commonly used clinical scoring 
systems, making it more suitable for clinical application.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram developed in this study offers an effective assessment 
of short-term mortality risk for ICU patients with COPD and CHF, proving to be a 
superior tool for predicting their short-term prognosis.

Background and aim A variety of scoring systems are employed in intensive care 
units (ICUs) with the objective of predicting patient morbidity and mortality. 
The present study aimed to compare four different severity assessment scoring 
systems, namely, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), 
Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA), and Simplified Acute Physiologic Score II (SAPS II) to predict prognosis 
of all patients admitted to a mixed medical ICU of a tertiary care teaching 
hospital in central India. Methods The prospective observational study included 
1136 patients aged 18 years or more, admitted to the mixed medical ICU. All 
patients underwent severity assessment using the four scoring systems, namely 
APACHE II, SOFA, REMS, and SAPS II, after admission. Predicted mortality was 
calculated from each of the scores and actual patient outcomes were noted. 
Receiver operating curve analysis was undertaken to identify the cut-off value 
of individual scoring systems for predicting mortality with optimum sensitivity 
and specificity. Calibration and discrimination were employed to ascertain the 
validity of each scoring model. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression 
analyses among the study participants were conducted to identify the best 
scoring system, after adjusting for potential confounders. Results Final 
analysis was done on 957 study participants (mean (±SD) age-58.4 (±12.9) years; 
males-62.2%). The mortality rate was 14.7%. APACHE II, SOFA, SAPS II, and REMS 
scores were significantly higher among the non-survivors as compared to the 
survivors (p<0.05). SAPS II was found to have the highest AUC of 0.981 
(p<0.001). SAPS II score >58 had 93.6% sensitivity, 94.1% specificity, 73.3% 
PPV, 98.8% NPV, and 94.0% diagnostic accuracy in predicting mortality. This 
scoring system also had the best calibration. Binary logistic regression showed 
that all four scoring systems were significantly associated with ICU mortality. 
After adjusting for each other, only SAPS II remained significantly associated 
with ICU mortality. Conclusion Both SAPS II and APACHE II were observed to have 
good calibration and discriminatory power; however, SAPS II had the best 
prediction power suggesting that it may be a useful tool for clinicians and 
researchers in assessing the severity of illness and mortality risk in 
critically ill patients.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM) is a common and 
life-threatening complication of sepsis, significantly contributing to elevated 
mortality. This study aimed to identify crucial indicators for the prompt and 
early assessment of SICM.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with sepsis or SICM within 24 h of intensive care 
unit (ICU) admission were enrolled in this prospective observational study. 
Patients were assigned to the training set, validation set and external test 
set. The primary endpoint was 7-day ICU mortality, and the secondary endpoint 
was 28-day ICU mortality. Three machine learning algorithms were utilized to 
identify relevant indicators for diagnosing SICM, incorporating 64 indicators 
including serum biomarkers associated with cardiac, renal, and liver function, 
lipid metabolism, coagulation, and inflammation. Internal and external 
validations were performed on the screening results. Patients were then 
stratified based on the cut-off value of the most diagnostically effective 
biomarker identified, and their prognostic outcomes were observed and analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 270 patients were included in the training and validation 
set, and 52 patients were included in the external test set. Age, sex, and 
comorbidities did not significantly differ between the sepsis and SICM groups 
(P > 0.05). The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm identified six indicators 
with an accuracy of 84.5%, the random forest (RF) algorithm identified six 
indicators with an accuracy of 81.9%, and the logistic regression (LR) algorithm 
screened out seven indicators. Following rigorous selection, a diagnostic model 
for sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy was established based on heart-type fatty acid 
binding protein (H-FABP) (OR 1.308, 95% CI 1.170-1.462, P < 0.001) and 
retinol-binding protein (RBP) (OR 1.020, 95% CI 1.006-1.034, P < 0.05). H-FABP 
alone exhibited the highest diagnostic performance in both the internal (AUROC 
0.689, P < 0.05) and external sets (AUROC 0.845, P < 0.05). Patients with SICM 
were further stratified based on an H-FABP diagnostic cut-off value of 
8.335 ng/mL. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated that elevated H-FABP 
levels at admission were associated with higher 7-day ICU mortality in patients 
with SICM (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that H-FABP concentrations measured within 24 h 
of patient admission could serve as a crucial biomarker for the early and rapid 
diagnosis and short-term prognostic evaluation of SICM.

BACKGROUND: Studies comparing percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) and surgical 
tracheostomy (ST) complications in the critically ill patient population with 
high acuity, complexity, and severity of illness are sparse. This study 
evaluated the outcomes of elective PT versus ST in such patients managed at a 
quaternary referral center.
AIMS: The primary aim was to detect a difference in hospital mortality between 
the two techniques. The secondary aims were to compare Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 
mortality, complications (including stoma site, tracheostomy-related, and 
decannulation complications), ICU and hospital length of stay, and time to 
decannulation.
METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective observational study of ICU 
admission from August 2018 to August 2021. Patients were included if an elective 
tracheostomy was performed during their ICU admission. Patients with a 
pre-existing tracheostomy and those who underwent an obligatory tracheostomy 
requirement (e.g. total laryngectomy) were excluded. Cohorts were matched using 
Hainmueller's entropy balancing. Binary data were evaluated using logistic 
regression and continuous data with ordinary least squares regression.
RESULTS: 349 patients with a tracheostomy were managed in the ICU during the 
observation period. They were predominantly males (75% in PT; 67% in ST), with a 
mean age in the PT and ST group of (47; SD = 18) and (55; SD = 16), 
respectively. After exclusion, 135 patients remained, with 63 in the PT group 
and 72 in the ST group. Patients receiving ST were significantly older with a 
higher Body Mass Index (BMI) than the PT group. There were no significant 
differences in gender, Acute Physiological And Chronic Health Evaluation 
(APACHE) III, and the Australian and New Zealand Risk Of Death (ANZROD) between 
the two groups. There was no difference in hospital mortality between groups (OR 
0.91, CI 0.26-3.18, p = 0.88). There were also no differences in ICU mortality, 
ICU and hospital length of stay, and time to decannulation. PT was associated 
with a greater likelihood of complications (OR 4.19; 95% CI 1.73-10.13; 
p < 0.01). PT was associated with a greater risk of complications in those who 
had this performed early (<10 days of intubation) as well as late (>10 days of 
intubation).
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous tracheostomy was associated with higher complications 
compared to surgical tracheostomy. They were related to tracheostomy cuff 
deflation, stomal site bleeding and infection, sputum plugging, and accidental 
and failed decannulation. These findings have identified opportunities to 
improve patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: The study is aimed to investigate the association between different 
corticosteroid treatment regimens and clinical status, complications, mechanical 
ventilation requirement, and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in individuals 
diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive retrospective study. Patients 
admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 and treated with low- or medium-dose 
corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone at a dose of 0.5-1 mg/kg for 7-10 
days) were compared with patients treated with high-dose pulse corticosteroid 
therapy (methylprednisolone at varying doses of 250 mg, 500 mg or 1000 mg for 
3-7 days) in addition to standard therapy because of increased pulmonary 
infiltrate and elevated inflammatory markers during clinical monitoring. All 
demographic and clinical data, including age, sex, clinical course, laboratory 
findings, discharge status, 28-day mortality, intubation status, acute 
physiological assessment and chronic health evaluation II score, Charlson 
Comorbidity Index, and sequential organ failure assessment score, were recorded.
RESULTS: Corticosteroid treatment was administered to 689 (88.3%) of 780 
COVID-19 ICU patients between April 2020 and October 2021. The overall mortality 
rate was 45.1% (n= 352). When the mortality rates of patients were compared 
according to the corticosteroid dose, the mortality rate in the 
low-to-medium-dose group (40%) was significantly lower than that in the 
high-dose group (76%). In addition, significant deterioration in laboratory and 
clinical parameters was observed in the high-dose corticosteroid group.
CONCLUSION: High mortality, adverse effects, and complications were 
significantly increased when high-dose corticosteroids were administered. 
Corticosteroid therapy should be used cautiously according to the patient's 
clinical condition, disease stage, comorbidities, and systemic or organ 
reserves.

BACKGROUND: Age as an eligibility criterion for V-V ECMO is widely debated and 
varies among healthcare institutions. We examined how age relates to mortality 
in patients undergoing V-V ECMO for ARDS.
METHODS: Systematic review and meta-regression of clinical studies published 
between 2015 and June 2024. Studies involving at least 6 ARDS patients treated 
with V-V ECMO, with specific data on ICU and/or hospital mortality and patient 
age were included. The search strategy was executed in PubMed, limited to 
English-language. COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 populations were analyzed 
separately. Meta-regressions of mortality outcomes on age were performed using 
gender, BMI, SAPS II, APACHE II, Charlson comorbidity index or SOFA as 
covariates.
RESULTS: In non-COVID ARDS, the meta-regression of 173 studies with 56,257 
participants showed a significant positive association between mean age and 
ICU/hospital mortality. In COVID-19 ARDS, a significant relationship between 
mean age and ICU mortality, but not hospital mortality, was found in 103 studies 
with 21,255 participants. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings, 
highlighting a linear relationship between age and mortality in both groups. For 
each additional year of mean age, ICU mortality increased by 1.2% in non-COVID 
ARDS and 1.9% in COVID ARDS.
CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between age and ICU mortality is linear and shows 
no inflection point. Consequently, no age cut-off can be recommended for 
determining patient eligibility for V-V ECMO.

Hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate < 2.5 mg/dL) is a major concern when 
initiating nutritional support. We evaluated which factors contribute to 
hypophosphatemia development in critically ill patients, as well as the 
association between hypophosphatemia and mortality. A retrospective cohort study 
of patients who were ventilated for at least 2 days in a 16-bed mixed ICU. Data 
collected includes demographics, Acute Physiology & Chronic Health Evaluation 2 
(APACHE2) admission score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at 24 h 
(SOFA24), hourly energy delivery, plasma phosphate levels during the first 2 
weeks of admission, ICU length of stay (LOS), length of ventilation (LOV), and 
mortality (ICU and 90 days). For the hypophosphatemia development model, we 
considered mortality as a competing risk. For mortality analysis, we used the 
Cox proportional hazards model considering hypophosphatemia development as a 
time-varying covariate. 462 patients were used in the analysis. 59.52% of the 
patients developed hypophosphatemia. Several factors were associated with a 
decreased risk of hypophosphatemia: age, BMI, pre-admission diabetes diagnosis, 
APACHE2, SOFA24, first kidney SOFA score, hospital admission time before ICU 
admission, and admission after liver transplantation. Admission due to trauma 
was associated with an increased risk of hypophosphatemia. Survival analysis 
with hypophosphatemia as a time-varying covariate showed a protective effect of 
hypophosphatemia from mortality (HR 0.447, 95% CI 0.281, 0.712). Age, APACHE2, 
and SOFA24 score were found to be significantly associated with ICU mortality. 
Fasting duration in the ICU before nutritional support initiation was not found 
to be significantly associated with hypophosphatemia. We examined several 
fasting intervals (12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 60 h, 72 h). In each fast interval, 
we compared the prevalence of hypophosphatemia among patients who fasted the 
specified length of time, with those who did not fast for the same length of 
time. In each fasting interval, hypophosphatemia prevalence was lower in the 
fasting group compared to the non-fasting group. However, this difference was 
insignificant. BMI, APACHE2, and hospital LOS before ICU admission were 
inversely associated with hypophosphatemia development. Fasting for up to 72 h 
in the ICU before starting nutritional support did not affect hypophosphatemia 
occurrence. Hypophosphatemia was associated with lower mortality.

BACKGROUND: Continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) is often used for acute 
kidney injury (AKI) or fluid overload (FO) in children ≤ 10 kg. Intensive care 
unit (ICU) mortality in children ≤ 10 kg reported by the prospective pediatric 
CRRT (ppCRRT, 2001-2003) registry was 57%. We aimed to evaluate characteristics 
associated with ICU mortality using a contemporary registry.
METHODS: The Worldwide Exploration of Renal Replacement Outcomes Collaborative 
in Kidney Disease (WE-ROCK) registry is a retrospective, multinational, 
observational study of children and young adults aged 0-25 years receiving CKRT 
(2015-2021) for AKI or FO. This analysis included patients ≤ 10 kg at hospital 
admission.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: ICU mortality and major adverse kidney events at 
90 days (MAKE-90) defined as death, persistent kidney dysfunction, or dialysis 
within 90 days, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were included (median age 0.53 years (IQR, 0.1, 
0.9)). ICU mortality was 46.5%. MAKE-90 occurred in 150/207 (72%). CKRT was 
initiated at a median 3 days (IQR 1, 9) after ICU admission and lasted a median 
6 days (IQR 3, 16). On multivariable analysis, pediatric logistic organ 
dysfunction score (PELOD-2) at CKRT initiation was associated with increased 
odds of ICU mortality (aOR 2.64, 95% CI 1.68-4.16), and increased odds of 
MAKE-90 (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.31-3.69). Absence of comorbidity was associated with 
lower MAKE-90 (aOR 0.29, 95%CI 0.13-0.65).
CONCLUSIONS: We report on a contemporary cohort of children ≤ 10 kg treated with 
CKRT for acute kidney injury and/or fluid overload. ICU mortality is decreased 
compared to ppCRRT. The extended risk of death and morbidity at 90 days 
highlights the importance of close follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Among therapeutic options for severe and critical COVID- 19 
infection, dexamethasone six milligrams once daily for ten days has demonstrated 
mortality benefit and is guideline recommended at this dose. In practice, 
variable doses of steroids have been used, especially in critical care settings. 
Our study aimed to determine the pattern of steroid dosing and outcomes in terms 
of critical care mortality, occurrence of dysglycaemias, and occurrence of 
superadded infections in patients with critical COVID-19.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out on all eligible patients 
admitted to the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, with critical COVID-19 
between 1st March 2020 and 31st December 2021. The intervention of interest was 
corticosteroids quantified as the average daily dose in milligrams of 
dexamethasone. A steroid dose of six milligrams once a day was compared to high 
dose steroid dosing, which was defined as any dose greater than this. The 
primary outcome measure was ICU mortality and secondary outcomes included 
occurrence of dysglycaemias, superadded infections and duration of critical care 
admission.
RESULTS: The study included 288 patients. The median age was 61.2 years (IQR: 
49.7, 72.5), with 71.2% of patients being male. The most common comorbidities 
were diabetes mellitus (60.7%), hypertension (58%), and heart disease (12.2%). 
The average oxygen saturation and C-reactive protein at admission were 82% [IQR: 
70.0-89.0]and 113.0 [IQR: 54.0-186.0], respectively. Fifty-eight percent of 
patients received a standard dose (6mg) of steroids. The mortality rate was 
higher in the high-dose group compared to the standard-dose group; however, the 
difference was not statistically significant (47.9% vs 43.7% p = 0.549). The two 
most common steroid associated adverse effects were uncomplicated hyperglycemia 
(62.2%) and superimposed bacterial pneumonia (20.1%). The high-dose group had a 
higher incidence of uncomplicated hyperglycemia compared to the standard-dose 
group (63.6% vs 61.1%). However, the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis was 
lower in the high dose group (0.6% vs 6.6%). Oxygen saturation at admission was 
associated with survival where it was lower among non-survivor patients with 
critical COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: The study found that high-dose steroids in the treatment of 
critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia did not confer any mortality 
benefit and were associated with an increased risk of dysglycemia and 
superimposed infections.

BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response holds paramount significance in the 
context of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and exhibits a robust correlation with 
mortality rates. Biological markers such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), 
systemic immune inflammation index (SII), and systemic inflammatory response 
index (SIRI) play crucial roles in influencing the systemic inflammatory 
response following ICH. This study aims to compare the predictive efficacy of 
NLR, PLR, LMR, SII, and SIRI concerning the risk of mortality in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) among critically ill patients with ICH. Such a comparison seeks 
to elucidate their early warning capabilities in the management and treatment of 
ICH.
METHODS: Patients with severe ICH requiring admission to the ICU were screened 
from the Medical Information Marketplace for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. 
The outcomes studied included ICU mortality and 30 day ICU hospitalization 
rates, based on tertiles of the NLR index level. To explore the relationship 
between the NLR index and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with ICH, 
we utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, decision curve 
analysis (DCA), and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 869 patients (51.9% male) were included in the study, with 
an ICU mortality rate of 22.9% and a 30 day ICU hospitalization rate of 98.4%. 
Among the five indicators examined, both the ROC curve and DCA indicated that 
NLR (AUC: 0.660, 95%CI: 0.617-0.703) had the highest predictive ability for ICU 
mortality. Moreover, this association remained significant even after adjusting 
for other confounding factors during multivariate analysis (HR: 3.520, 95%CI: 
2.039-6.077). Based on the results of the multivariate analysis, incorporating 
age, albumin, lactic acid, NLR, and GCS score as variables, we developed a 
nomogram to predict ICU mortality in critically ill patients with ICH.
CONCLUSION: NLR emerges as the most effective predictor of ICU mortality risk 
among critically ill patients grappling with ICH when compared to the other four 
indicators. Furthermore, the integration of albumin and lactic acid indicators 
into the NLR nomogram enhances the ability to promptly identify ICU mortality in 
individuals facing severe ICH.

BACKGROUND: To further identify the association of the triglyceride-glucose 
(TyG) index with the risk of mortality among critically ill patients admitted to 
the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched for 
relevant studies up to February 2, 2024. The primary outcomes were in-hospital 
mortality and ICU mortality. The secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, 
90-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. The hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were combined to evaluate the associations between 
the TyG index and the above endpoints. All the statistical analyses were 
performed with STATA 15.0 software.
RESULTS: Ten studies involving 22,694 patients were included. The pooled results 
demonstrated that an elevated TyG index indicated an increased risk of 
in-hospital mortality (HR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.41-2.18, P < .001), ICU mortality 
(HR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.33-1.74, P < .001), 30-day mortality (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 
1.02-2.19, P = .037), 90-day mortality (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.01-2.00, P = .043), 
and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.11-1.28, P < .001). Subgroup analysis 
for in-hospital mortality and ICU mortality based on sex, age, body mass index 
and hypertension showed similar results. However, subgroup analysis stratified 
by diabetes mellitus (DM) revealed that the associations of the TyG index with 
in-hospital mortality (HR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.30-3.78, P = .004) and ICU mortality 
(HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 0.95-3.94, P = .070) were observed only among patients 
without DM.
CONCLUSION: The TyG index was significantly associated with mortality among 
critically ill patients without DM, and an elevated TyG index predicted an 
increased risk of mortality.

Comparison Between Early and Late Tracheostomy in ICU Patients Including 
COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study at a Tertiary 
Care Hospital.

Background Tracheostomy is a common intervention for intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients for various reasons. The superiority of early versus late tracheostomy 
is still unfounded for non-COVID-19 cases. The COVID-19 pandemic complicated the 
matter, as little literature was available on the ideal timing of tracheostomy 
for patients with COVID-19. Research question This study aimed to establish the 
superiority of early or late tracheostomy for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases by 
comparing outcomes, including ICU mortality, ventilation days after 
tracheostomy, and ICU length of stay (LOS). Study design and methods A 
single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted on ventilated ICU 
patients both with and without COVID-19 at a university hospital between January 
2020 and December 2021. During the study period, 1,393 ventilated patients were 
scanned, and 156 were found to be tracheostomized. Tracheostomy was considered 
to be early when performed within 10 days of intubation, after which it was 
considered to be late. Results Tracheostomy was performed early for 84/156 
(53.8%) of tracheostomized patients and late for 72/156 (46.2%) of patients. The 
overall mortality was 42.9% (36/84) versus 69.4% (50/72) (P=0.001, OR=3.03, 95% 
CI=1.563-5.874), 31.4% versus 65.5% in the non-COVID-19 group and 60.6% versus 
72.1% (P=0.005, OR=2.640, 95% CI=1.345-5.181) in the COVID-19 group for the 
early and late tracheostomy groups, respectively. Ventilation days were higher 
for the late tracheostomy group than for the early tracheostomy group in the 
non-COVID-19 group (17.10 versus 9.18 days, P<0.001). However, it was almost the 
same for the early and late tracheostomy groups in the COVID-19 group (14.15 
versus 13.86 days, P=0.821). The ICU LOS was greater for the late tracheostomy 
group for both the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. Multivariate analysis 
revealed that ICU mortality is significantly associated with age, ventilation 
days, and ICU LOS. Interpretation The results of this study indicate that early 
tracheostomy was associated with lower mortality, fewer ventilation days, and 
shorter LOS in both the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups.

OBJECTIVE: Coagulopathy score has been applied as a new prognostic indicator for 
sepsis, heart failure and acute respiratory failure. However, its ability to 
forecast intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with an acute cerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) has not been assessed. The purpose of this study was to clarify 
the relationship between ICU mortality and early coagulation problem score.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
(v2.0) database were used in this retrospective cohort analysis. The association 
between the coagulation disorder score and ICU mortality was examined using 
multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, the impact of additional 
variables on the results was investigated by a subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: 3174 patients (57.3 % male) were enrolled in total. The ICU mortality 
reached 18.2 %. After adjusting for potential confounders, the ICU mortality of 
patients rose with the increase of coagulation disorder score. The ROC curve 
revealed the predictive accuracy of coagulation dysfunction score to mortality 
in patients with ICU. The coagulation disorder score had a lower AUC value 
(0.601, P < 0.001) than the SAPSII(AUCs of 0.745[95 % CI, 0.730-0.761]) and the 
combined indicators(AUCs of 0.752[95 % CI, 0.737-0.767]), but larger than single 
indicators platelet, INR and APTT. In the subgroup analysis, most subgroups 
showed no significant interaction, but only age showed significant interaction 
in the adjusted model.
CONCLUSION: The coagulopathy score and ICU mortality were found to be strongly 
positively correlated in this study, and its ability to predict ICU mortality 
was better than that of a single measure (platelet, INR, or APTT), but worse 
than that of the SAPSII score, GCS system.

OBJECTIVES: Continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is recommended for 
status epilepticus (SE) management in ICU but is still underused due to resource 
limitations and inconclusive evidence regarding its impact on outcome. 
Furthermore, the term ""continuous monitoring"" often implies continuous recording 
with variable intermittent review. The establishment of a dedicated 
ICU-electroencephalogram unit may fill this gap, allowing cEEG with nearly 
real-time review and multidisciplinary management collaboration. This study 
aimed to evaluate the effect of ICU-electroencephalogram unit establishing on SE 
outcome and management.
DESIGN: Single-center retrospective before-after study.
SETTING: Neuro-ICU of a Swiss academic tertiary medical care center.
PATIENTS: Adult patients treated for nonhypoxic SE between November 1, 2015, and 
December 31, 2023.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Data from all SE patients were assessed, comparing 
those treated before and after ICU-electroencephalogram unit introduction. 
Primary outcomes were return to premorbid neurologic function, ICU mortality, SE 
duration, and ICU SE management. Secondary outcomes were SE type and etiology. 
Two hundred seven SE patients were included, 149 (72%) before and 58 (38%) after 
ICU-electroencephalogram unit establishment. ICU-electroencephalogram unit 
introduction was associated with increased detection of nonconvulsive SE ( p = 
0.003) and SE due to acute symptomatic etiology ( p = 0.019). Regression 
analysis considering age, comorbidities, SE etiology, and SE semeiology revealed 
a higher chance of returning to premorbid neurologic function ( p = 0.002), 
reduced SE duration ( p = 0.024), and a shift in SE management with increased 
use of antiseizure medications ( p = 0.007) after ICU-electroencephalogram unit 
introduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrating neurology expertise in the ICU setting through the 
establishment of an ICU-electroencephalogram unit with nearly real-time cEEG 
review, shortened SE duration, and increased likelihood of returning to 
premorbid neurologic function, with an increased number of antiseizure 
medications used. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and 
assess long-term prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a disease that threatens global public safety. In 
recent years, the obesity paradox has been studied in cardiovascular disease and 
other fields. With the progress of aging, metabolic changes and regulation of 
fat function, it also provides many bridges for the dialogue between disease and 
molecular metabolism. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of 
obesity on the outcome of adult intensive care patients with heart failure 
combined with age factors.
METHOD: Data were derived from the fourth-generation Medical Information 
Marketplace for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV version2.1) using structured query 
language on the Navicat (12.0.11) platform. People were divided into two groups 
based on the body mass index (BMI), one group with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² and another 
group with BMI < 30 kg/m². Afterwards, the patients were divided into two 
subgroups based on their ages. One group included patients aged<60, and the 
other included patients aged ≥ 60. The extracted information includes 
demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, comorbidities, scores. Main 
results included in-hospital mortality, ICU mortality, and 1-year mortality. 
Secondary outcomes included hospital interval and ICU interval, use of renal 
replacement therapy, and rates of noninvasive and invasive ventilation support.
RESULT: In this cohort study, 3390 people were in the BMI<30 group, 2301 people 
were in the BMI ≥ 30 group, 960 people were in the age<60 group, and 4731 people 
were in the age ≥ 60 group, including 3557 patients after propensity score 
matching in high age group. Among patients aged ≥ 60, BMI ≥ 30 group vs. BMI<30 
group showed significantly lower in-hospital mortality (13% vs. 16%) and 
one-year mortality (41% vs. 55%), respectively. Neither primary nor secondary 
outcomes were significantly described in the competition among patients aged 
under 60. Restricted cubic spline reveals a J-shaped nonlinear association 
between BMI and clinical endpoints within the entire cohort. Kaplan-Meier curves 
revealed a survival advantage in BMI ≥ 30 group (p < 0.001). Following age 
stratification, a beneficial effect of BMI categories on one-year mortality risk 
was observed in heart failure patients aged ≥ 60 (Univariable HR, 0.71, 95% CI, 
0.65-0.78, p < 0.001; Multivariable HR, 0.74, 95% CI, 0.67-0.81, p < 0.001), but 
not in those under 60 years old.
OUTCOME: In ICU patients with heart failure, obesity offers a survival benefit 
to those aged ≥ 60. No obesity paradox was observed in patients younger than 60 
years old. The obesity paradox applies to patients aged ≥ 60 with heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Pre-existing and new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is a common 
arrhythmia in COVID-19 patients and is related to increased mortality. 
CHA2DS2-VASc score was initially developed to evaluate thromboembolic risk in 
patients with AF. Moreover, it predicted adverse outcomes in other clinical 
conditions, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to evaluate the association 
of CHA2DS2-VASc with NOAF, ICU length of stay (LOS) and mortality in critically 
ill COVID-19 patients. We also examined the relationship of NOAF with mortality. 
We reviewed the literature to describe the link between cardiovascular risk 
factors and inflammatory response of severe COVID-19.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 163 COVID-19 patients admitted 
to a level 3 general ICU from March 2020 to April 2022. Patients were of 
advanced age (median 64 years, IQR 56.5-71) and the majority of them were male 
(67.5%). Regarding NOAF, we excluded 12 patients with AF history. In this group, 
CHA2DS2VASc score was significantly elevated (3 IQR (1-4) versus 1 IQR (1-2.75), 
p = 0.003). Specifically, three components of CHA2DS2VASc were notably 
increased: age (p < 0.001), arterial hypertension (p = 0.042) and stroke 
(p = 0.047). ICU mortality was raised in the NOAF group [75.8% versus 34.8%, 
p < 0.001 OR 5.87, 95% CI (2.43, 14.17)]. This was significant even after 
adjusting for ICU clinical scores (APACHE II and SOFA). About mortality in the 
entire sample, survivors were younger (p = 0.001). Non-survivors had greater 
APACHE II (p = 0.04) and SOFA (p = 0.033) scores. CHA2DS2VASc score was 
positively associated with mortality [p = 0.031, OR 1.28, 95% CI (1.03, 1.6)]. 
ICU length of stay was associated with mortality (p = 0.016) but not with 
CHA2DS2VASc score (p = 0.842).
CONCLUSIONS: NOAF and CHA2DS2VASc score were associated with higher mortality in 
COVID-19 ICU patients. CHA2DS2VASc score was also associated with NOAF but not 
with ICU LOS.

OBJECTIVES: Severe thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) frequently affects 
the kidney, heart, and central nervous system. The precise frequency, clinical 
picture, differential diagnoses, and outcome of APS-related hematological 
involvement are lacking, especially in patients requiring ICU admission. This 
study aimed to describe the hematological manifestations associated with 
critically ill thrombotic APS patients and catastrophic antiphospholipid 
syndrome.
METHODS: This French, national, multicenter, retrospective study, conducted, 
from January 2000 to September 2018, included all APS patients admitted to 24 
participating centers' ICUs with any new thrombotic manifestation. The 
prevalence of hematological manifestations and their associated outcomes were 
studied.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four patients, female 72%, median [IQR] age 45 
[34-56] years, with 152 episodes were included. Anemia was present in 95% of 
episodes and thrombocytopenia in 93%. The lowest values for hemoglobin and 
platelets were 7.1 [6.3-8.8] g/dL and 38 [21-60] g/L, respectively. The lowest 
platelet count below 20 g/L was significantly associated with a higher in-ICU 
mortality rate (50%, p < 0.0001). A thrombotic microangiopathy syndrome (TMA) 
syndrome was seen in 16 patients (12%) and was associated with higher 
in-hospital mortality (p = 0.05). Median ADAMTS-13 levels were 44% [27-74]. 
Anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies were tested in 11 patients and found negative in all. A 
suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was raised in 66 patients 
but only four patients were classified as definite HIT. Disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC) was seen in 51% of patients.
CONCLUSION: Thrombocytopenia is very frequent in severe APS patients and may be 
related to TMA, HIT, or DIC. Deciphering the mechanisms of thrombocytopenia is 
decisive in CAPS patients. Key Points • Thrombocytopenia is the hallmark 
laboratory finding in CAPS. • A complete thrombotic microangiopathy pattern is 
infrequent in CAPS patients. • Alternate diagnoses of CAPS, especially 
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, need to be adequately investigated.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of Pacific and European 
patients admitted to New Zealand (NZ) intensive care units (ICUs) 2009-2018.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The NZ Ministry of Health National Minimum Dataset and 
the Australia NZ Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database were matched. 
Data were for ICU admissions in NZ hospitals from July 2009 until June 2018; 
long-term mortality outcomes were obtained from the NZ death registry until June 
2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was day 180 mortality. Secondary 
outcomes were ICU mortality, hospital mortality, discharge to home, ICU and 
hospital length of stay, and survival. We evaluated the associations between 
Pacific ethnicity and outcomes with European as the reference using regression 
analyses. We adjusted sequentially for site, deprivation status, sex, year of 
admission, Charlson Comorbidity Index, age, admission source and type, ICU 
admission diagnosis, ventilation status, and illness severity.
RESULTS: Pacific people had a median age of 14 years younger than Europeans. 
644/4603 (14.0%) Pacific, and 6407/42,871 (14.9%) European patients died within 
180 days of ICU admission; odds ratio (OR) 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85-1.01. When 
adjusting for age, the OR for day 180 mortality for Pacific vs. European 
patients increased. The OR decreased after adjustment for admission source and 
type, and after accounting for Pacific patients having a higher comorbidity 
index and more severe illness. In the final model, incorporating adjustments for 
all specified variables, Pacific ethnicity was not significantly associated with 
day 180 mortality (adjusted OR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.80-1.05). Findings were similar 
for secondary outcomes except for the proportion of patients discharged home; 
Pacific ethnicity was associated with significantly increased odds of being 
discharged home compared to European ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Pacific ethnicity was not associated with increased day 180 
mortality compared to European ethnicity; Pacific patients admitted to the ICU 
were more likely to be discharged home than European patients.

BACKGROUND: Pathogenic diversity may have contributed to the high mortality of 
pneumonia-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (p-ARDS). Metagenomics 
next-generation sequencing (mNGS) serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for early 
pathogen identification. However, its clinical utility in p-ARDS remains 
understudied. There are still limited researches on the etiology, clinical 
characteristics and risk factors for 28-day mortality in p-ARDS patients.
METHODS: A single center retrospective cohort study of 75 p-ARDS patients was 
conducted. Patients were categorized into survival and deceased groups based on 
their 28-day outcomes. A comprehensive clinical evaluation was conducted, 
including baseline characteristics, laboratory indicators, outcomes and pathogen 
identification by mNGS and traditional microbiological testing. We then 
evaluated the diagnostic value of mNGS and identified clinical characteristics 
and risk factors for 28-day mortality in p-ARDS.
RESULT: The overall ICU mortality was 26.67%, and the 28-day mortality was 
57.33%, with 32 cases (42.67%) in the survival group, and 43 cases (57.33%) in 
the deceased group. Patients in the deceased group were older than those in the 
survival group (68(59,73) years vs. 59(44,67) years, P=0.04). The average 
lengths of ICU and hospital stay were 9(5,13) days and 14(7,21) days, 
respectively. The survival group had longer lengths of ICU and hospital stay 
(ICU: 11(7,17) days and hospital: 17(9,27) days) compared to the deceased group 
(ICU: 8(4,11) days and hospital: 12(6,19) days) (P<0.05). Survival patients 
exhibited lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score 
on the 3rd and 7th days, higher lymphocyte counts, higher CD3+ and CD8+ T cell 
counts compared to deceased patients (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis identified age, APACHE II scores on 3rd and 7th days, CD8+ T cell count 
and length of ICU as independent risk factors for 28-day mortality in p-ARDS 
patients. mNGS demonstrated a significantly higher overall pathogen detection 
rate (70/75, 93.33%) compared to the traditional method (50/75, 66.67%, 
P=0.022). The average turnaround time (TAT) for mNGS was significantly shorter 
at 1(1,1) day compared to 4(3,5) days for the traditional method (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Metagenome next-generation sequencing can be used as a valuable tool 
for identifying pathogens in p-ARDS, reducing diagnostic time and improving 
accuracy. Early application of mNGS alongside traditional methods is recommended 
for p-ARDS. Furthermore, older age, higher APACHE II scores, lower lymphocyte 
counts and lymphocyte subset counts were associated with increased mortality in 
p-ARDS patients, highlighting the importance of timely assessment of immune 
status and disease severity, especially in elderly.

BACKGROUND: Endothelial activation and stress index (EASIX) reflects endothelial 
dysfunction or damage. Because endothelial dysfunction is one of the key 
mechanisms, a few studies have shown the clinical usefulness of original and 
age-adjusted EASIX (age-EASIX) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of age-EASIX in predicting 
intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in 
South Korea.
METHODS: Secondary analysis was performed using clinical data retrospectively 
collected from 22 nationwide hospitals in South Korea between January 1, 2020, 
and August 31, 2021. Patients were at least 19 years old and admitted to the ICU 
for severe COVID-19, demanding at least high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. 
EASIX [lactate dehydrogenase (U/L)×creatinine (mg/dL)/platelet count (109 
cells/L)] and age-EASIX (EASIX×age) were calculated and log2-transformed.
RESULTS: The mean age of 908 critically ill patients with COVID-19 was 67.4 
years with 59.7% male sex. The mean log2 age-EASIX was 7.38±1.45. Non-survivors 
(n=222, 24.4%) in the ICU had a significantly higher log2 age-EASIX than of 
survivors (8.2±1.52 vs. 7.1±1.32, p&lt;0.001). log2 age-EASIX was significantly 
associated with ICU mortality (odds ratio, 1.541; 95% confidence interval, 1.322 
to 1.796; p&lt;0.001) and had a better area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve than of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) 
score in predicting ICU mortality (0.730 vs. 0.660, p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Age-EASIX is significantly associated with ICU mortality and has 
better discriminatory ability than the SOFA score in predicting ICU mortality.

BACKGROUND: A prediction model that estimates mortality at admission to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) is of potential benefit to both patients and society. 
Logistic regression models like Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3) and 
APACHE are the traditional ICU mortality prediction models. With the emergence 
of machine learning (machine learning) and artificial intelligence, new 
possibilities arise to create prediction models that have the potential to 
sharpen predictive accuracy and reduce the likelihood of misclassification in 
the prediction of 30-day mortality.
METHODS: We used the Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR) to identify and 
include all patients ≥18 years of age admitted to general ICUs in Sweden from 
2008 to 2022 with SAPS 3 score registered. Only data collected within 1 h of ICU 
admission was used. We had 153 candidate predictors including baseline 
characteristics, previous medical conditions, blood works, physiological 
parameters, cause of admission, and initial treatment. We stratified the data 
randomly on the outcome variable 30-day mortality and created a training set 
(80% of data) and a test set (20% of data). We evaluated several hundred 
prediction models using multiple ML frameworks including random forest, gradient 
boosting, neural networks, and logistic regression models. Model performance was 
evaluated by comparing the receiver operator characteristic area under the curve 
(AUC-ROC). The best performing model was fine-tuned by optimizing 
hyperparameters. The model's calibration was evaluated by a calibration belt. 
Ultimately, we simplified the best performing model with the top 1-20 
predictors.
RESULTS: We included 296,344 first-time ICU admissions. We found age, Glasgow 
Coma Scale, creatinine, systolic blood pressure, and pH being the most important 
predictors. The AUC-ROC was 0.884 in test data using all predictors, specificity 
95.2%, sensitivity 47.0%, negative predictive value of 87.9% and positive 
predictive value of 70.7%. The final model showed excellent calibration. The ICU 
risk evaluation for 30-day mortality (ICURE) prediction model performed equally 
well to the SAPS 3 score with only eight variables and improved further with the 
addition of more variables.
CONCLUSION: The ICURE prediction model predicts 30-day mortality rate at 
first-time ICU admission superiorly compared to the established SAPS 3 score.
