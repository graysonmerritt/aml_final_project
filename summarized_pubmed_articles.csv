OBJECTIVES: The survival rate of people with HIV admitted to intensive care 
units (ICUs) is approaching that of people without HIV. We conducted a 
matched-cohort study of people with and without HIV admitted to ICU at a large 
hospital to compare short-term mortality, during 2000-2019.
METHODS: People with HIV were matched to people without HIV (1:2) on age, sex, 
admission year and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II 
score. Applying logistic regression models fitted using independence estimating 
equations, we describe population-averaged associations of HIV with short-term 
(in-ICU, in-hospital) mortality during a patient's first admission to ICU, and 
explore whether these varied by year.
RESULTS: A total of 177 people with HIV were matched to 354 people without HIV 
(71.2% vs. 71.2% male; median age: 47 vs. 48 years, median APACHE-II: 18 vs. 17, 
median admission year: 2013 vs. 2013). Among people with HIV, 73.4% were on 
antiretroviral therapy, 51.2% had HIV-RNA ≤50 copies/mL and median CD4 T-cell 
count was 132 cells/ μ L. People with HIV had higher in-ICU (24.3% vs. 15.3%) 
and in-hospital (31.6% vs. 20.1%) mortality. People with HIV had 1.69-fold 
higher odds (95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.76) of in-ICU mortality and 1.86 
(1.19-2.91) higher odds of in-hospital mortality than people without HIV, 
adjusted for age, sex, year and APACHE-II. There was no evidence that these 
associations varied by year (p-interaction-in-ICU = 0.90; 
p-interaction-in-hospital = 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that although outcomes have improved over 
time, people with HIV continue to have higher short-term in-ICU and in-hospital 
mortality following ICU admission compared with people without HIV with similar 
characteristics.

INTRODUCTION: The vaccination drive for COVID-19 was launched in India after the 
authorization of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Covishield), an adenoviral vector vaccine, and 
BBV152 COVID-19 (Covaxin), an inactivated virus vaccine. As stated by the CDC, 
vaccine-related adverse events can happen. In this study, we aimed to assess the 
timing of the COVID vaccination and admission diagnosis and their effect on ICU 
mortality. The time from vaccination can help identify adverse events directly 
related to vaccination.  Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted 
across four centers in India. Patients who took the first or second dose of any 
vaccines and were admitted with non-COVID illness to the ICU were included in 
the study. Patients were categorized based on the time interval from vaccination 
as ≤42 days or >42 days. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. The secondary 
outcomes were the length of ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 
53.49 (15.89) years, and 61.14% were males. The ICU mortality was 24.57% (18.38% 
to 31.63%). Thromboembolic events such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 
cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and mesenteric ischemia were seen in 7.43%, 
7.43%, and 1.14% of patients, respectively. Six patients (3.43%) developed 
neuromuscular illness. The mortality was higher in patients >66 years, followed 
by ≤35 years of age when admitted ≤42 days of vaccination (p=0.008). The 
mortality was higher in cerebrovascular disorders and was clinically significant 
(p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients developed thromboembolic events and neuromuscular diseases 
requiring ICU admission post-COVID vaccination. We observed a significantly 
higher mortality in the age groups >66 years and ≤35 years when admitted within 
42 days of COVID vaccination. Patients admitted with cerebrovascular diseases 
also had higher mortality.

OBJECTIVES: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy combined with 
enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols has improved postoperative 
outcomes, yet concerns persist regarding complications and readmissions. Limited 
research has explored intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and outcomes within 
this context. This study aimed to analyze ICU admissions following VATS 
lobectomy within an established ERAS protocol.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent VATS lobectomy between 2018-2023 
were included. Patient data were obtained from our prospective institutional 
database, while ICU data were extracted from electronic patients' records.
RESULTS: Of 2099 patients included, 48 (2.3%) required ICU admission. Median-age 
was 70 (IQR : 64-76), with ICU patients being older and predominantly male 
(73%). Overall 30-day-mortality was 1.0% with an ICU mortality of 31%. Multiple 
logistic regression revealed significant associations between ICU admission and 
male gender (p = <0.001), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.026), heart failure 
(p = 0.040), DLCO%(0.013). Median time to ICU admission was 4 days (IQR : 2-10). 
Respiratory failure was the primary reason for ICU admission (60%). Severe 
surgical complications accounted for 8.3% of all ICU-admissions.
CONCLUSIONS: In an ERAS setting, the incidence of ICU admission following VATS 
lobectomy was 2.3%, with a mortality rate of 31%. Respiratory failure was the 
leading cause of ICU admission.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients 
admitted to the intensive care unit with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2, 
comparing them according to successive waves, and to identify prognostic factors 
for morbidity and mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center retrospective observational 
descriptive study was conducted from March 10, 2020, to October 17, 2021. All 
adult patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia presenting acute respiratory 
failure were included. COVID 19 diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR testing of 
respiratory specimens. The primary endpoint was ICU mortality. Secondary 
endpoints were the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 437 patients were included of whom 282 (65%) 
patients were ventilated for 9 [5;20] days. Among the studied population, 38% 
were treated for one or more episodes of VAP, and 22 (5%) for bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis. ICU mortality was 26% in the first wave, then fell and stabilized 
at around 10% in subsequent waves (p = 0.02). Increased age, Charlson index, 
SOFA score and lactatemia on admission were predictive of mortality. Survival at 
90 days was 85% (95% CI 82-88) and was unaffected by the presence of VAP. 
However, the occurrence of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis increased mortality to 
36%.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed mortality in the lower range of those 
previously reported. Risk factors for mortality mainly included age and previous 
comorbidities. The prognosis of these critically ill Covid 19 patients improved 
over the four waves, underlining the likely beneficial effect of vaccination and 
dexamethasone.

The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score was developed to overcome the 
limitations of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) when assessing individuals with 
impaired consciousness. We sought to review the evidence regarding the 
predictive validity of the GCS and FOUR score in intensive care unit (ICU) 
settings. This review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023420528). 
Systematic searches of CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase were undertaken. Prospective 
observational studies were included if both GCS and FOUR score were assessed in 
adults during ICU admission and if mortality and/or validated functional outcome 
measure scores were collected. Studies were excluded if they exclusively 
investigated patients with traumatic brain injury. Screening, data extraction, 
and quality assessment using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool were 
conducted by two reviewers. Twenty studies of poor to moderate quality were 
included. Many studies only included patients with neurological illness and 
excluded sedated patients, despite high proportions of intubated patients. The 
FOUR score achieved higher area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve values for mortality prediction compared with the GCS, and the FOUR score 
achieved significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve values for predictions of ICU mortality. Both coma scales showed similar 
accuracy in predicting ""unfavorable"" functional outcome. The FOUR score appeared 
to be more responsive than the GCS in the ICU, as most patients with a GCS score 
of 3 obtained FOUR scores between 1 and 8 due to preserved brainstem function. 
The FOUR score may be superior to the GCS for predicting mortality in ICU 
settings. Further adequately powered studies with clear, reliable methods for 
assessment of index and outcome scores are required to clarify the predictive 
performance of both coma scales in ICUs. Inclusion of sedated patients may 
improve generalizability of findings in general ICU populations.

BACKGROUND: Various social determinants of health have been established as 
significant risk factors for COVID-19 transmission, prevalence, incidence, and 
mortality. Area deprivation index (ADI, a composite score made up of 
educational, housing, and poverty markers) is an accepted multidimensional 
social determinants of health measure. Little is known about how structural 
social determinants of health before hospitalization, including ADI, may affect 
mortality related to COVID-19 in critically ill patients.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of ADI with intensive care unit (ICU) 
mortality in patients with COVID-19 and compare its predictive power with that 
of clinical factors.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of critically ill adults with 
COVID-19 in 3 hospitals within a single health system. Multivariable logistic 
regression models (adjusted for demographic and clinical variables) were used to 
examine the association of ADI with ICU mortality.
RESULTS: Data from 1784 patients hospitalized from 2020 to 2022 were analyzed. 
In multivariable models, no association was found between national ADI and ICU 
mortality. Notable factors associated with ICU mortality included treatment 
year, age, van Walraven weighted score, invasive mechanical ventilation, and 
body mass index.
CONCLUSION: In this study, clinical factors were more predictive of mortality 
than ADI and other social determinants of health. The influence of ADI may be 
most relevant before hospital admission. These findings could serve as a 
foundation for shaping targeted public health strategies and hospital 
interventions, enhancing care delivery, and potentially contributing to better 
outcomes in future pandemics.

BACKGROUND: Anthropometric measurements are crucial in pediatric critical care, 
but the impact of height on ICU outcomes is underexplored despite a substantial 
number of short-for-age children in ICUs. Previous studies suggest that short 
stature increases the risk of poor clinical outcomes. This study examines the 
relationship between short stature and ICU outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a Japanese nationwide 
database (the Japanese Intensive Care Patient Database; JIPAD), which included 
pediatric patients under 16 years admitted to ICUs from April 2015 to March 
2020. Height standard deviation scores (SD scores) were calculated based on age 
and sex. Short-stature patients were defined as height SD score <  - 2. The 
primary outcome was all-cause ICU mortality, and the secondary outcome was the 
length of stay in ICU.
RESULTS: Out of 6,377 pediatric patients, 27.2% were classified as having short 
stature. The ICU mortality rate was significantly higher in the short-stature 
group compared to the normal-height group (3.6% vs. 1.4%, p < 0.01). 
Multivariable logistic regression showed that short stature was independently 
associated with increased ICU mortality (OR = 2.73, 95% CI 1.81-4.11). 
Additionally, the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards model indicated that short 
stature was associated with a lower chance of ICU discharge for each additional 
day (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.90, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Short stature is a significant risk factor for increased ICU 
mortality and prolonged ICU stay in critically ill children. Height should be 
considered in risk assessments and management strategies in pediatric intensive 
care to improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Systemic corticosteroid has been recommended for the treatment of 
severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). 
Little is known about the use of systemic corticosteroid in patients admitted to 
intensive care units (ICU) since most of previous trials excluded these 
critically ill patients.
METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study based on the Medical Information 
Mart in Intensive Care-IV database. Patients with AECOPD in ICUs were included. 
Patients in the exposure group should be intravenously administrated with 
methylprednisolone or treated with oral prednisone within 24 h after ICU 
admission. The propensity score matching and multivariable analyses were used to 
adjust for covariates. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary 
outcomes included ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, the duration of ICU 
stay, and mechanical ventilation. Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome were 
performed according to age, sex, type of corticosteroid, type of ICU admission, 
type of mechanical ventilation, and co-morbidities/complications.
RESULTS: The entire cohort and the matched cohort included 763 and 412 patients, 
respectively. In the matched cohort, the use of systemic corticosteroid had no 
impact on 28-day mortality (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.61-1.64, P = 1.000). The results 
kept consistent in all subgroups. Additionally, systemic corticosteroid showed 
no benefits on ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, the length of ICU stay, and 
the duration of mechanical ventilation.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not support routine use of systemic 
corticosteroid in patients with AECOPD admitted to ICUs.

PURPOSE: There is a paucity of data from sub-Saharan Africa describing Severe 
Community Acquired Pneumonia (SCAP), a condition with significant morbidity and 
mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centre, observational 
study of consecutive patients with SCAP admitted to the ICU at Charlotte Maxeke 
Johannesburg Academic Hospital, in South Africa between 1 July 2007 and 31 May 
2019. Pneumonia was categorised as community-acquired if there had been no 
hospitalization in the preceding 2 weeks.
RESULTS: We identified 931 patients, (median age 37 [IQR 30-48] years), with the 
predominant co-morbidity being HIV co-infection (77.1 %). The median CURB-65 and 
APACHE II scores were 3 (IQR 2-3) and 18 (IQR 14-23) respectively, and most 
patients had multilobar consolidation on chest X-ray. Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
was the most common aetiology, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The latter, 
and Pneumocystis jirovecii were more common amongst survivors and non-survivors, 
respectively. ICU mortality was 50.1 % and 85 % of patients required 
ventilation, mostly invasive mechanical ventilation. Ventilated patients and 
those requiring inotropic support and/or dialysis were more likely to die.
CONCLUSION: We have described a cohort of patients with SCAP, with a 
comprehensive overview of all putative microbiological causes, which to our 
knowledge, is the largest reported in the literature.

The Brazilian Amazon is a vast area with limited health care resources. To 
assess the epidemiology of critically ill acute kidney injury (AKI) patients in 
this area, a prospective cohort study of 1029 adult patients of the three 
intensive care units (ICUs) of Rio Branco city, the capital of Acre state, were 
evaluated from February 2014 to February 2016. The incidence of AKI was 53.3%. 
Risk factors for AKI included higher age, nonsurgical patients, admission to the 
ICU from the ward, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 
(APACHE) II scores at ICU admission, and positive fluid balance > 1500 ml/24 
hours in the days before AKI development in the ICU, with aOR of 1.3 (95% CI 
1.03-1.23), 1.47 (95% CI 1.07-2.03), 1.96 (95% CI 1.40-2.74), 1.05 (95% CI 
1.03-1.08) for each unit increase, and 1.62 (95% CI 1.16-2.26), respectively. 
AKI was associated with higher ICU mortality (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.29-3.18). AKI 
mortality was independently associated with higher age, nonsurgical patients, 
sepsis at ICU admission, presence of shock or use of vasoactive drugs, 
mechanical ventilation and mean positive fluid balance in the ICU > 1500 ml/24 
hours, both during ICU follow-up, with aOR 1.27 (95% CI 1.14-1.43) for each 
10-year increase, 1.64 (95% CI 1.07-2.52), 2.35 (95% CI 1.14-4.83), 1.88 (95% CI 
1.03-3.44), 6.73 (95% CI 4.08-11.09), 2.31 (95% CI 1.52-3.53), respectively. 
Adjusted hazard ratios for AKI mortality 30 and 31-180 days after ICU discharge 
were 3.13 (95% CI 1.84-5.31) and 1.69 (95% CI 0.99-2.90), respectively. AKI 
incidence was strikingly high among critically ill patients in the Brazilian 
Amazon. The AKI etiology, risk factors and outcomes were similar to those 
described in high-income countries, but mortality rates were higher.

Background and objective Sepsis and septic shock are major healthcare issues in 
surgical patients admitted to the surgery ward or ICU, affecting millions of 
people worldwide annually, with a mortality rate between one in three and one in 
six of those affected. The incidence and mortality of sepsis vary greatly by 
region, with the highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, South Asia, 
East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Of all sepsis cases in 2017, 33.1 million people 
suffered from ill health due to underlying infectious diseases, and 15.8 million 
suffered from underlying injuries or non-communicable diseases.  Methods This 
prospective observational study was conducted at the Jimma University Medical 
Centre (JUMC) in Jimma town in southwest Ethiopia, from April 2023 to October 
2023. All surgical patients aged ≥15 years who presented with or developed 
septic shock at the Jimma University Medical Centre were included. Results The 
study involved a total of 61 patients. The median age of the patients was 45 
years [interquartile range (IQR): 40-60 years], and 77% (n=47) of the patients 
were male. The most frequent source of infection in this study was 
community-acquired infection (83.3%, n=49). The most common focus of sepsis was 
the intra-abdominal infection of the digestive system (82%, n=50). Lactate level 
testing and blood cultures before administering antibiotics were not done for 
all septic shock patients. Source control surgery was performed in 52.5% (n=32) 
of patients after developing septic shock, and 84.4% (n=27) of surgeries were 
performed within 24 hours. The 30-day mortality rate was 80.3%, with an ICU 
mortality rate of 78.94%. The median length of stay in the ICU was three days 
(IQR: 1-5 days), and the median length of hospital stay was six days (IQR: 2-15 
days). Conclusions The mortality rate in our cohort was higher compared to that 
in studies from high-income and low-income countries. There was poor adherence 
and compliance with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) (the one-hour bundle) 
guidelines. The length of stay in hospitals and ICUs was lower compared to 
studies from high-income countries due to the high early mortality rates.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the correlation between hyperglycemia at 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and the incidence of acute kidney injury 
(AKI) in patients after cardiac surgery.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, in which clinical data were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database. Adults (≥18 years) in the database who were admitted to the 
cardiovascular intensive care unit after cardiac surgery were enrolled. The 
primary outcome was the incidence of AKI within 7 days following ICU admission. 
Secondary outcomes included ICU mortality, hospital mortality, ICU length of 
stay, and the 28-day and 90-day mortality. Multivariable Cox regression analysis 
was used to assess the association between ICU-admission hyperglycemia and AKI 
incidence within 7 days of ICU admission. Different adjustment strategies were 
used to adjust for potential confounders. Patients were divided into three 
groups according to their highest blood glucose levels recorded within 24 h of 
ICU admission: no hyperglycemia (<140 mg/dL), mild hyperglycemia (140-200 
mg/dL), and severe hyperglycemia (≥200 mg/dL).
RESULTS: Of the 6905 included patients, 2201 (31.9%) were female, and the median 
(IQR) age was 68.2 (60.1-75.9) years. In all, 1836 (26.6%) patients had severe 
hyperglycemia. The incidence of AKI within 7 days of ICU admission, ICU 
mortality, and hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with 
severe admission hyperglycemia than those with mild hyperglycemia or no 
hyperglycemia (80.3% vs. 73.6% and 61.2%, respectively; 2.8% vs. 0.9% and 1.9%, 
respectively; and 3.4% vs. 1.2% and 2.5%, respectively; all P <0.001). Severe 
hyperglycemia was a risk factor for 7-day AKI (Model 1: hazard ratio 
[HR]=1.4809, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3126 to 1.6707; Model 2: HR=1.1639, 
95% CI: 1.0176 to 1.3313; Model 3: HR=1.2014, 95% CI: 1.0490 to 1.3760; all P 
<0.050). Patients with normal glucose levels (glucose levels <140 mg/dL) had a 
higher 28-day mortality rate than those with severe hyperglycemia (glucose 
levels ≥200 mg/dL) (4.0% vs. 3.8%, P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In post-cardiac surgery patients, severe hyperglycemia within 24 h 
of ICU admission increases the risk of 7-day AKI, ICU mortality, and hospital 
mortality. Clinicians should be extra cautious regarding AKI among patients with 
hyperglycemia at ICU admission after cardiac surgery.

BACKGROUND: Stress hyperglycemia is now more common in intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients and is strongly associated with poor prognosis. Whether this 
association exists in critically ill patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) is 
unknown. This study investigated the prognostic relationship of stress 
hyperglycemia on critically ill patients with CS.
METHODS: We included 393 critically ill patients with CS from the MIMIC IV 
database in this study and categorized the patients into four groups based on 
quartiles of Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR). We assessed the correlation 
between SHR and mortality using restricted cubic spline analysis and Cox 
proportional hazards models. The primary outcomes observed were ICU mortality 
and hospitalization mortality.
RESULTS: The mean age of the entire study population was 68 years, of which 30% 
were male (118 cases). There was no significant difference between the four 
groups in terms of age, gender, BMI, and vital signs (P>0.05). There was an 
increasing trend in the levels of lactate (lac), white blood cell count (WBC), 
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), glucose and Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) from 
group Q1 to group Q2, with the greatest change in patients in group Q4 (P<0.05) 
and the patients in group Q4 had the highest use of mechanical ventilation, the 
longest duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay. After 
adjusting for confounders, SHR was found to be strongly associated with patient 
ICU mortality, showing a U-shaped relationship.
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with CS, stress hyperglycemia assessed by 
SHR was significantly associated with patient ICU mortality.

This study delves into the correlation between the triglyceride glucose-body 
mass index (TyG-BMI) index upon hospital admission and clinical outcomes among 
this patient population. We investigated the association between TyG-BMI at 
hospital admission and clinical outcomes in this patient group, and analyzed 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, 
identifying acute pancreatitis (AP) patients admitted to ICUs and stratifying 
them by TyG-BMI quartiles. We assessed the relationship between TyG-BMI and 
mortality (both in-hospital and ICU) using Cox proportional hazards regression 
and restricted cubic splines. The cohort included 419 patients, average age 
56.34 ± 16.62 years, with a majority being male (61.58%). Hospital and ICU 
mortality rates were 11.93% and 7.16%, respectively. Higher TyG-BMI was 
positively correlated with increased all-cause mortality. Patients in the 
highest TyG-BMI quartile had significantly greater risks of in-hospital and ICU 
mortality. An S-shaped curve in the spline analysis indicated a threshold effect 
at a TyG-BMI of 243 for increased in-hospital mortality risk. TyG-BMI is a 
reliable predictor of both in-hospital and ICU mortality in severely ill AP 
patients, suggesting its utility in enhancing risk assessment and guiding 
clinical interventions for this vulnerable population.

BACKGROUND: Age is a significant consideration for intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission. However, the reported associations between increasing age and 
mortality vary across studies, and data in the local context of Malaysia are 
lacking. The objective of the present study was to determine the impact of 
increasing age on ICU mortality.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of ICU patients was conducted between 
January 2020 and November 2023 at a university hospital in Malaysia. Patients 
were classified into two categories according to age (years) and into four 
groups according to National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings 
(MeSH): young adult (19-24), adult (25-44), middle age (45-64), and elderly 
(≥65). The Cochran-Armitage test for trend and Cox proportional hazards 
regression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of increasing age on 
ICU mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1,661 patients was analyzed. The Cochran-Armitage test 
showed a significant positive association between ICU mortality rate and age 
group (Z=-4.86, P<0.01) or MeSH category (Z=-5.36, P<0.01). After adjusting for 
other confounders, the strongest predictor for ICU mortality in the Cox 
proportional hazards regression analyses was age, with the elderly age group 
having the highest adjusted hazard ratio of 4.777 (95% CI, 1.128-20.231; 
P=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Age had a significant impact on ICU mortality in our cohort of 
critically ill patients.

University, Bangkok, Thailand.

BACKGROUND: Hypothermia is a relatively common complication in patients 
receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). However, few studies have 
reported the factors associated with hypothermia.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in five intensive care units 
(ICUs) to evaluate the incidence of hypothermia and the predictive factors for 
developing hypothermia during CRRT, with hypothermia defined as a time-weighted 
average temperature <36 °C.
RESULTS: From January 2020 to December 2021, 300 patients were enrolled. 
Hypothermia developed in 23.7% of them within the first 24 hours after CRRT 
initiation. Compared to non-hypothermic patients, hypothermic patients were 
older and had lower body weight, more frequent acidemia, and higher ICU and 
30-day mortality rates. In the multivariate analysis, age >70 years (odds ratio 
[OR], 2.59; 95% CI, 1.38-4.98; P=0.004), higher positive fluid balance on the 
day before CRRT (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.22; P=0.02), and CRRT dose (OR, 1.003; 
95% CI, 1.00-1.01; P=0.04) were significantly associated with hypothermia. 
Conversely, a higher body weight was independently associated with mitigated 
risk of hypothermia (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.97; P=0.01). Moreover, a higher 
coefficient of variance of temperature was associated with greater ICU mortality 
(OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.13-1.78; P=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Hypothermia during CRRT is a relatively common occurrence, and 
factors associated with hypothermia onset in the first 24 hours include older 
age, lower body weight, higher positive fluid balance on the day before CRRT, 
and higher CRRT dose. Greater temperature variability was associated with 
increased ICU mortality.

BACKGROUND: Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a dependable indicator of insulin 
resistance, has been identified as a valid marker regarding multiple 
cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the correlation of TyG index with acute 
myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) remains 
uncertain. Our study aims for elucidating this relationship by comprehensively 
analyzing two large-scale cohorts.
METHODS: Utilizing records from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, the link between TyG and the 
incidence and prognosis of AMICS was assessed multicentrally and retrospectively 
by logistic and correlation models, as well as restricted cubic spline (RCS). 
Propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting 
(IPTW), and overlap weighting (OW) were employed to balance the potential 
confounders. Subgroup analyses were performed according to potential modifiers.
RESULTS: Overall, 5208 AMI patients, consisting of 375 developing CS were 
finally included. The TyG index exhibited an apparently higher level in AMI 
populations developing CS than in those who did not experienced CS [9.2 
(8.8-9.7) vs. 9.0 (8.5-9.5)], with a moderate discrimination ability to 
recognize AMICS from the general AMI (AUC: 0.604). Logistic analyses showed that 
the TyG index was significantly correlated with in-hospital and ICU mortality. 
RCS analysis demonstrated a linear link between elevated TyG and increased risks 
regarding in-hospital and ICU mortality in the AMICS population. An increased 
mortality risk remains evident in PSM-, OW- and IPTW-adjusted populations with 
higher TyG index who have undergone CS. Correlation analyses demonstrated an 
apparent link between TyG index and APS score. Subgroup analyses presented a 
stable link between elevated TyG and mortality particularly in older age, 
females, those who are overweight or hypertensive, as well as those without 
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TyG index was related to the incidence of CS following AMI 
and higher mortality risks in the population with AMICS. Our findings pointed a 
previously undisclosed role of TyG index in regard to AMICS that still requires 
further validation.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM) is a common and 
life-threatening complication of sepsis, significantly contributing to elevated 
mortality. This study aimed to identify crucial indicators for the prompt and 
early assessment of SICM.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with sepsis or SICM within 24 h of intensive care 
unit (ICU) admission were enrolled in this prospective observational study. 
Patients were assigned to the training set, validation set and external test 
set. The primary endpoint was 7-day ICU mortality, and the secondary endpoint 
was 28-day ICU mortality. Three machine learning algorithms were utilized to 
identify relevant indicators for diagnosing SICM, incorporating 64 indicators 
including serum biomarkers associated with cardiac, renal, and liver function, 
lipid metabolism, coagulation, and inflammation. Internal and external 
validations were performed on the screening results. Patients were then 
stratified based on the cut-off value of the most diagnostically effective 
biomarker identified, and their prognostic outcomes were observed and analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 270 patients were included in the training and validation 
set, and 52 patients were included in the external test set. Age, sex, and 
comorbidities did not significantly differ between the sepsis and SICM groups 
(P > 0.05). The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm identified six indicators 
with an accuracy of 84.5%, the random forest (RF) algorithm identified six 
indicators with an accuracy of 81.9%, and the logistic regression (LR) algorithm 
screened out seven indicators. Following rigorous selection, a diagnostic model 
for sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy was established based on heart-type fatty acid 
binding protein (H-FABP) (OR 1.308, 95% CI 1.170-1.462, P < 0.001) and 
retinol-binding protein (RBP) (OR 1.020, 95% CI 1.006-1.034, P < 0.05). H-FABP 
alone exhibited the highest diagnostic performance in both the internal (AUROC 
0.689, P < 0.05) and external sets (AUROC 0.845, P < 0.05). Patients with SICM 
were further stratified based on an H-FABP diagnostic cut-off value of 
8.335 ng/mL. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated that elevated H-FABP 
levels at admission were associated with higher 7-day ICU mortality in patients 
with SICM (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that H-FABP concentrations measured within 24 h 
of patient admission could serve as a crucial biomarker for the early and rapid 
diagnosis and short-term prognostic evaluation of SICM.

OBJECTIVES: The study is aimed to investigate the association between different 
corticosteroid treatment regimens and clinical status, complications, mechanical 
ventilation requirement, and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in individuals 
diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive retrospective study. Patients 
admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 and treated with low- or medium-dose 
corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone at a dose of 0.5-1 mg/kg for 7-10 
days) were compared with patients treated with high-dose pulse corticosteroid 
therapy (methylprednisolone at varying doses of 250 mg, 500 mg or 1000 mg for 
3-7 days) in addition to standard therapy because of increased pulmonary 
infiltrate and elevated inflammatory markers during clinical monitoring. All 
demographic and clinical data, including age, sex, clinical course, laboratory 
findings, discharge status, 28-day mortality, intubation status, acute 
physiological assessment and chronic health evaluation II score, Charlson 
Comorbidity Index, and sequential organ failure assessment score, were recorded.
RESULTS: Corticosteroid treatment was administered to 689 (88.3%) of 780 
COVID-19 ICU patients between April 2020 and October 2021. The overall mortality 
rate was 45.1% (n= 352). When the mortality rates of patients were compared 
according to the corticosteroid dose, the mortality rate in the 
low-to-medium-dose group (40%) was significantly lower than that in the 
high-dose group (76%). In addition, significant deterioration in laboratory and 
clinical parameters was observed in the high-dose corticosteroid group.
CONCLUSION: High mortality, adverse effects, and complications were 
significantly increased when high-dose corticosteroids were administered. 
Corticosteroid therapy should be used cautiously according to the patient's 
clinical condition, disease stage, comorbidities, and systemic or organ 
reserves.

BACKGROUND: Age as an eligibility criterion for V-V ECMO is widely debated and 
varies among healthcare institutions. We examined how age relates to mortality 
in patients undergoing V-V ECMO for ARDS.
METHODS: Systematic review and meta-regression of clinical studies published 
between 2015 and June 2024. Studies involving at least 6 ARDS patients treated 
with V-V ECMO, with specific data on ICU and/or hospital mortality and patient 
age were included. The search strategy was executed in PubMed, limited to 
English-language. COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 populations were analyzed 
separately. Meta-regressions of mortality outcomes on age were performed using 
gender, BMI, SAPS II, APACHE II, Charlson comorbidity index or SOFA as 
covariates.
RESULTS: In non-COVID ARDS, the meta-regression of 173 studies with 56,257 
participants showed a significant positive association between mean age and 
ICU/hospital mortality. In COVID-19 ARDS, a significant relationship between 
mean age and ICU mortality, but not hospital mortality, was found in 103 studies 
with 21,255 participants. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings, 
highlighting a linear relationship between age and mortality in both groups. For 
each additional year of mean age, ICU mortality increased by 1.2% in non-COVID 
ARDS and 1.9% in COVID ARDS.
CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between age and ICU mortality is linear and shows 
no inflection point. Consequently, no age cut-off can be recommended for 
determining patient eligibility for V-V ECMO.

Institute, Aga Khan University, Nairobi, Kenya.

BACKGROUND: Among therapeutic options for severe and critical COVID- 19 
infection, dexamethasone six milligrams once daily for ten days has demonstrated 
mortality benefit and is guideline recommended at this dose. In practice, 
variable doses of steroids have been used, especially in critical care settings. 
Our study aimed to determine the pattern of steroid dosing and outcomes in terms 
of critical care mortality, occurrence of dysglycaemias, and occurrence of 
superadded infections in patients with critical COVID-19.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out on all eligible patients 
admitted to the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, with critical COVID-19 
between 1st March 2020 and 31st December 2021. The intervention of interest was 
corticosteroids quantified as the average daily dose in milligrams of 
dexamethasone. A steroid dose of six milligrams once a day was compared to high 
dose steroid dosing, which was defined as any dose greater than this. The 
primary outcome measure was ICU mortality and secondary outcomes included 
occurrence of dysglycaemias, superadded infections and duration of critical care 
admission.
RESULTS: The study included 288 patients. The median age was 61.2 years (IQR: 
49.7, 72.5), with 71.2% of patients being male. The most common comorbidities 
were diabetes mellitus (60.7%), hypertension (58%), and heart disease (12.2%). 
The average oxygen saturation and C-reactive protein at admission were 82% [IQR: 
70.0-89.0]and 113.0 [IQR: 54.0-186.0], respectively. Fifty-eight percent of 
patients received a standard dose (6mg) of steroids. The mortality rate was 
higher in the high-dose group compared to the standard-dose group; however, the 
difference was not statistically significant (47.9% vs 43.7% p = 0.549). The two 
most common steroid associated adverse effects were uncomplicated hyperglycemia 
(62.2%) and superimposed bacterial pneumonia (20.1%). The high-dose group had a 
higher incidence of uncomplicated hyperglycemia compared to the standard-dose 
group (63.6% vs 61.1%). However, the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis was 
lower in the high dose group (0.6% vs 6.6%). Oxygen saturation at admission was 
associated with survival where it was lower among non-survivor patients with 
critical COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: The study found that high-dose steroids in the treatment of 
critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia did not confer any mortality 
benefit and were associated with an increased risk of dysglycemia and 
superimposed infections.

BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response holds paramount significance in the 
context of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and exhibits a robust correlation with 
mortality rates. Biological markers such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), 
systemic immune inflammation index (SII), and systemic inflammatory response 
index (SIRI) play crucial roles in influencing the systemic inflammatory 
response following ICH. This study aims to compare the predictive efficacy of 
NLR, PLR, LMR, SII, and SIRI concerning the risk of mortality in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) among critically ill patients with ICH. Such a comparison seeks 
to elucidate their early warning capabilities in the management and treatment of 
ICH.
METHODS: Patients with severe ICH requiring admission to the ICU were screened 
from the Medical Information Marketplace for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. 
The outcomes studied included ICU mortality and 30 day ICU hospitalization 
rates, based on tertiles of the NLR index level. To explore the relationship 
between the NLR index and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with ICH, 
we utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, decision curve 
analysis (DCA), and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 869 patients (51.9% male) were included in the study, with 
an ICU mortality rate of 22.9% and a 30 day ICU hospitalization rate of 98.4%. 
Among the five indicators examined, both the ROC curve and DCA indicated that 
NLR (AUC: 0.660, 95%CI: 0.617-0.703) had the highest predictive ability for ICU 
mortality. Moreover, this association remained significant even after adjusting 
for other confounding factors during multivariate analysis (HR: 3.520, 95%CI: 
2.039-6.077). Based on the results of the multivariate analysis, incorporating 
age, albumin, lactic acid, NLR, and GCS score as variables, we developed a 
nomogram to predict ICU mortality in critically ill patients with ICH.
CONCLUSION: NLR emerges as the most effective predictor of ICU mortality risk 
among critically ill patients grappling with ICH when compared to the other four 
indicators. Furthermore, the integration of albumin and lactic acid indicators 
into the NLR nomogram enhances the ability to promptly identify ICU mortality in 
individuals facing severe ICH.

of Nursing, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

BACKGROUND: To further identify the association of the triglyceride-glucose 
(TyG) index with the risk of mortality among critically ill patients admitted to 
the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched for 
relevant studies up to February 2, 2024. The primary outcomes were in-hospital 
mortality and ICU mortality. The secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, 
90-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. The hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were combined to evaluate the associations between 
the TyG index and the above endpoints. All the statistical analyses were 
performed with STATA 15.0 software.
RESULTS: Ten studies involving 22,694 patients were included. The pooled results 
demonstrated that an elevated TyG index indicated an increased risk of 
in-hospital mortality (HR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.41-2.18, P < .001), ICU mortality 
(HR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.33-1.74, P < .001), 30-day mortality (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 
1.02-2.19, P = .037), 90-day mortality (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.01-2.00, P = .043), 
and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.11-1.28, P < .001). Subgroup analysis 
for in-hospital mortality and ICU mortality based on sex, age, body mass index 
and hypertension showed similar results. However, subgroup analysis stratified 
by diabetes mellitus (DM) revealed that the associations of the TyG index with 
in-hospital mortality (HR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.30-3.78, P = .004) and ICU mortality 
(HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 0.95-3.94, P = .070) were observed only among patients 
without DM.
CONCLUSION: The TyG index was significantly associated with mortality among 
critically ill patients without DM, and an elevated TyG index predicted an 
increased risk of mortality.

Comparison Between Early and Late Tracheostomy in ICU Patients Including 
COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study at a Tertiary 
Care Hospital.

OMN.

Background Tracheostomy is a common intervention for intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients for various reasons. The superiority of early versus late tracheostomy 
is still unfounded for non-COVID-19 cases. The COVID-19 pandemic complicated the 
matter, as little literature was available on the ideal timing of tracheostomy 
for patients with COVID-19. Research question This study aimed to establish the 
superiority of early or late tracheostomy for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases by 
comparing outcomes, including ICU mortality, ventilation days after 
tracheostomy, and ICU length of stay (LOS). Study design and methods A 
single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted on ventilated ICU 
patients both with and without COVID-19 at a university hospital between January 
2020 and December 2021. During the study period, 1,393 ventilated patients were 
scanned, and 156 were found to be tracheostomized. Tracheostomy was considered 
to be early when performed within 10 days of intubation, after which it was 
considered to be late. Results Tracheostomy was performed early for 84/156 
(53.8%) of tracheostomized patients and late for 72/156 (46.2%) of patients. The 
overall mortality was 42.9% (36/84) versus 69.4% (50/72) (P=0.001, OR=3.03, 95% 
CI=1.563-5.874), 31.4% versus 65.5% in the non-COVID-19 group and 60.6% versus 
72.1% (P=0.005, OR=2.640, 95% CI=1.345-5.181) in the COVID-19 group for the 
early and late tracheostomy groups, respectively. Ventilation days were higher 
for the late tracheostomy group than for the early tracheostomy group in the 
non-COVID-19 group (17.10 versus 9.18 days, P<0.001). However, it was almost the 
same for the early and late tracheostomy groups in the COVID-19 group (14.15 
versus 13.86 days, P=0.821). The ICU LOS was greater for the late tracheostomy 
group for both the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. Multivariate analysis 
revealed that ICU mortality is significantly associated with age, ventilation 
days, and ICU LOS. Interpretation The results of this study indicate that early 
tracheostomy was associated with lower mortality, fewer ventilation days, and 
shorter LOS in both the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups.

OBJECTIVE: Coagulopathy score has been applied as a new prognostic indicator for 
sepsis, heart failure and acute respiratory failure. However, its ability to 
forecast intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with an acute cerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) has not been assessed. The purpose of this study was to clarify 
the relationship between ICU mortality and early coagulation problem score.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
(v2.0) database were used in this retrospective cohort analysis. The association 
between the coagulation disorder score and ICU mortality was examined using 
multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, the impact of additional 
variables on the results was investigated by a subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: 3174 patients (57.3 % male) were enrolled in total. The ICU mortality 
reached 18.2 %. After adjusting for potential confounders, the ICU mortality of 
patients rose with the increase of coagulation disorder score. The ROC curve 
revealed the predictive accuracy of coagulation dysfunction score to mortality 
in patients with ICU. The coagulation disorder score had a lower AUC value 
(0.601, P < 0.001) than the SAPSII(AUCs of 0.745[95 % CI, 0.730-0.761]) and the 
combined indicators(AUCs of 0.752[95 % CI, 0.737-0.767]), but larger than single 
indicators platelet, INR and APTT. In the subgroup analysis, most subgroups 
showed no significant interaction, but only age showed significant interaction 
in the adjusted model.
CONCLUSION: The coagulopathy score and ICU mortality were found to be strongly 
positively correlated in this study, and its ability to predict ICU mortality 
was better than that of a single measure (platelet, INR, or APTT), but worse 
than that of the SAPSII score, GCS system.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a disease that threatens global public safety. In 
recent years, the obesity paradox has been studied in cardiovascular disease and 
other fields. With the progress of aging, metabolic changes and regulation of 
fat function, it also provides many bridges for the dialogue between disease and 
molecular metabolism. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of 
obesity on the outcome of adult intensive care patients with heart failure 
combined with age factors.
METHOD: Data were derived from the fourth-generation Medical Information 
Marketplace for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV version2.1) using structured query 
language on the Navicat (12.0.11) platform. People were divided into two groups 
based on the body mass index (BMI), one group with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² and another 
group with BMI < 30 kg/m². Afterwards, the patients were divided into two 
subgroups based on their ages. One group included patients aged<60, and the 
other included patients aged ≥ 60. The extracted information includes 
demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, comorbidities, scores. Main 
results included in-hospital mortality, ICU mortality, and 1-year mortality. 
Secondary outcomes included hospital interval and ICU interval, use of renal 
replacement therapy, and rates of noninvasive and invasive ventilation support.
RESULT: In this cohort study, 3390 people were in the BMI<30 group, 2301 people 
were in the BMI ≥ 30 group, 960 people were in the age<60 group, and 4731 people 
were in the age ≥ 60 group, including 3557 patients after propensity score 
matching in high age group. Among patients aged ≥ 60, BMI ≥ 30 group vs. BMI<30 
group showed significantly lower in-hospital mortality (13% vs. 16%) and 
one-year mortality (41% vs. 55%), respectively. Neither primary nor secondary 
outcomes were significantly described in the competition among patients aged 
under 60. Restricted cubic spline reveals a J-shaped nonlinear association 
between BMI and clinical endpoints within the entire cohort. Kaplan-Meier curves 
revealed a survival advantage in BMI ≥ 30 group (p < 0.001). Following age 
stratification, a beneficial effect of BMI categories on one-year mortality risk 
was observed in heart failure patients aged ≥ 60 (Univariable HR, 0.71, 95% CI, 
0.65-0.78, p < 0.001; Multivariable HR, 0.74, 95% CI, 0.67-0.81, p < 0.001), but 
not in those under 60 years old.
OUTCOME: In ICU patients with heart failure, obesity offers a survival benefit 
to those aged ≥ 60. No obesity paradox was observed in patients younger than 60 
years old. The obesity paradox applies to patients aged ≥ 60 with heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Pre-existing and new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is a common 
arrhythmia in COVID-19 patients and is related to increased mortality. 
CHA2DS2-VASc score was initially developed to evaluate thromboembolic risk in 
patients with AF. Moreover, it predicted adverse outcomes in other clinical 
conditions, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to evaluate the association 
of CHA2DS2-VASc with NOAF, ICU length of stay (LOS) and mortality in critically 
ill COVID-19 patients. We also examined the relationship of NOAF with mortality. 
We reviewed the literature to describe the link between cardiovascular risk 
factors and inflammatory response of severe COVID-19.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 163 COVID-19 patients admitted 
to a level 3 general ICU from March 2020 to April 2022. Patients were of 
advanced age (median 64 years, IQR 56.5-71) and the majority of them were male 
(67.5%). Regarding NOAF, we excluded 12 patients with AF history. In this group, 
CHA2DS2VASc score was significantly elevated (3 IQR (1-4) versus 1 IQR (1-2.75), 
p = 0.003). Specifically, three components of CHA2DS2VASc were notably 
increased: age (p < 0.001), arterial hypertension (p = 0.042) and stroke 
(p = 0.047). ICU mortality was raised in the NOAF group [75.8% versus 34.8%, 
p < 0.001 OR 5.87, 95% CI (2.43, 14.17)]. This was significant even after 
adjusting for ICU clinical scores (APACHE II and SOFA). About mortality in the 
entire sample, survivors were younger (p = 0.001). Non-survivors had greater 
APACHE II (p = 0.04) and SOFA (p = 0.033) scores. CHA2DS2VASc score was 
positively associated with mortality [p = 0.031, OR 1.28, 95% CI (1.03, 1.6)]. 
ICU length of stay was associated with mortality (p = 0.016) but not with 
CHA2DS2VASc score (p = 0.842).
CONCLUSIONS: NOAF and CHA2DS2VASc score were associated with higher mortality in 
COVID-19 ICU patients. CHA2DS2VASc score was also associated with NOAF but not 
with ICU LOS.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of Pacific and European 
patients admitted to New Zealand (NZ) intensive care units (ICUs) 2009-2018.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The NZ Ministry of Health National Minimum Dataset and 
the Australia NZ Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database were matched. 
Data were for ICU admissions in NZ hospitals from July 2009 until June 2018; 
long-term mortality outcomes were obtained from the NZ death registry until June 
2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was day 180 mortality. Secondary 
outcomes were ICU mortality, hospital mortality, discharge to home, ICU and 
hospital length of stay, and survival. We evaluated the associations between 
Pacific ethnicity and outcomes with European as the reference using regression 
analyses. We adjusted sequentially for site, deprivation status, sex, year of 
admission, Charlson Comorbidity Index, age, admission source and type, ICU 
admission diagnosis, ventilation status, and illness severity.
RESULTS: Pacific people had a median age of 14 years younger than Europeans. 
644/4603 (14.0%) Pacific, and 6407/42,871 (14.9%) European patients died within 
180 days of ICU admission; odds ratio (OR) 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85-1.01. When 
adjusting for age, the OR for day 180 mortality for Pacific vs. European 
patients increased. The OR decreased after adjustment for admission source and 
type, and after accounting for Pacific patients having a higher comorbidity 
index and more severe illness. In the final model, incorporating adjustments for 
all specified variables, Pacific ethnicity was not significantly associated with 
day 180 mortality (adjusted OR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.80-1.05). Findings were similar 
for secondary outcomes except for the proportion of patients discharged home; 
Pacific ethnicity was associated with significantly increased odds of being 
discharged home compared to European ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Pacific ethnicity was not associated with increased day 180 
mortality compared to European ethnicity; Pacific patients admitted to the ICU 
were more likely to be discharged home than European patients.

BACKGROUND: Pathogenic diversity may have contributed to the high mortality of 
pneumonia-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (p-ARDS). Metagenomics 
next-generation sequencing (mNGS) serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for early 
pathogen identification. However, its clinical utility in p-ARDS remains 
understudied. There are still limited researches on the etiology, clinical 
characteristics and risk factors for 28-day mortality in p-ARDS patients.
METHODS: A single center retrospective cohort study of 75 p-ARDS patients was 
conducted. Patients were categorized into survival and deceased groups based on 
their 28-day outcomes. A comprehensive clinical evaluation was conducted, 
including baseline characteristics, laboratory indicators, outcomes and pathogen 
identification by mNGS and traditional microbiological testing. We then 
evaluated the diagnostic value of mNGS and identified clinical characteristics 
and risk factors for 28-day mortality in p-ARDS.
RESULT: The overall ICU mortality was 26.67%, and the 28-day mortality was 
57.33%, with 32 cases (42.67%) in the survival group, and 43 cases (57.33%) in 
the deceased group. Patients in the deceased group were older than those in the 
survival group (68(59,73) years vs. 59(44,67) years, P=0.04). The average 
lengths of ICU and hospital stay were 9(5,13) days and 14(7,21) days, 
respectively. The survival group had longer lengths of ICU and hospital stay 
(ICU: 11(7,17) days and hospital: 17(9,27) days) compared to the deceased group 
(ICU: 8(4,11) days and hospital: 12(6,19) days) (P<0.05). Survival patients 
exhibited lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score 
on the 3rd and 7th days, higher lymphocyte counts, higher CD3+ and CD8+ T cell 
counts compared to deceased patients (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis identified age, APACHE II scores on 3rd and 7th days, CD8+ T cell count 
and length of ICU as independent risk factors for 28-day mortality in p-ARDS 
patients. mNGS demonstrated a significantly higher overall pathogen detection 
rate (70/75, 93.33%) compared to the traditional method (50/75, 66.67%, 
P=0.022). The average turnaround time (TAT) for mNGS was significantly shorter 
at 1(1,1) day compared to 4(3,5) days for the traditional method (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Metagenome next-generation sequencing can be used as a valuable tool 
for identifying pathogens in p-ARDS, reducing diagnostic time and improving 
accuracy. Early application of mNGS alongside traditional methods is recommended 
for p-ARDS. Furthermore, older age, higher APACHE II scores, lower lymphocyte 
counts and lymphocyte subset counts were associated with increased mortality in 
p-ARDS patients, highlighting the importance of timely assessment of immune 
status and disease severity, especially in elderly.

BACKGROUND: Endothelial activation and stress index (EASIX) reflects endothelial 
dysfunction or damage. Because endothelial dysfunction is one of the key 
mechanisms, a few studies have shown the clinical usefulness of original and 
age-adjusted EASIX (age-EASIX) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of age-EASIX in predicting 
intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in 
South Korea.
METHODS: Secondary analysis was performed using clinical data retrospectively 
collected from 22 nationwide hospitals in South Korea between January 1, 2020, 
and August 31, 2021. Patients were at least 19 years old and admitted to the ICU 
for severe COVID-19, demanding at least high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. 
EASIX [lactate dehydrogenase (U/L)×creatinine (mg/dL)/platelet count (109 
cells/L)] and age-EASIX (EASIX×age) were calculated and log2-transformed.
RESULTS: The mean age of 908 critically ill patients with COVID-19 was 67.4 
years with 59.7% male sex. The mean log2 age-EASIX was 7.38±1.45. Non-survivors 
(n=222, 24.4%) in the ICU had a significantly higher log2 age-EASIX than of 
survivors (8.2±1.52 vs. 7.1±1.32, p&lt;0.001). log2 age-EASIX was significantly 
associated with ICU mortality (odds ratio, 1.541; 95% confidence interval, 1.322 
to 1.796; p&lt;0.001) and had a better area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve than of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) 
score in predicting ICU mortality (0.730 vs. 0.660, p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Age-EASIX is significantly associated with ICU mortality and has 
better discriminatory ability than the SOFA score in predicting ICU mortality.
